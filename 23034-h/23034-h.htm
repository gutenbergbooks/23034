<p class="center" style="font-size: x-large">N. P. WILLIS,</p>

<p class="center">OF IDLEWILD.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Willis</span>,</p>

<p>While inscribing this work with your name, as a testimonial
of our long, unbroken friendship, you will let me say, I am sure,
not only how, but why I have written it.</p>

<p>About a year ago I was introduced to its hero, by Dr. James
Hall, the distinguished founder and first governor of our colony
at Cape Palmas. While busy with his noble task in Africa,
Dr. Hall accidentally became acquainted with Captain Canot,
during his residence at Cape Mount, and was greatly impressed
in his favor by the accounts of all who knew him. Indeed,&mdash;setting
aside his career as a slaver,&mdash;Dr. Hall&rsquo;s observation
convinced him that Canot was a man of unquestionable integrity.
The zeal, moreover, with which he embraced the first opportunity,
after his downfall, to mend his fortunes by honorable
industry in South America, entitled him to respectful confidence.
As their acquaintance ripened, my friend gradually drew from
the wanderer the story of his adventurous life, and so striking
were its incidents, so true its delineations of African character,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg&nbsp;iv]</a></span>
that he advised the captain to prepare a copious memorandum,
which I should write out for the public.</p>

<p>Let me tell you why I undertook this task; but first, let me
assure you that, entertaining as the story might have been for a
large class of readers, I would not have composed a line for the
mere gratification of scandalous curiosity. My conversations
with Canot satisfied me that his disclosures were more thoroughly
candid than those of any one who has hitherto related
his connection with the traffic. I thought that the evidence of
one who, for twenty years, played the chief part in such a drama,
was of value to society, which, is making up its mind, not only
about a great political and domestic problem, but as to the nature
of the race itself. I thought that a true picture of aboriginal
Africa,&mdash;unstirred by progress,&mdash;unmodified by reflected
civilization,&mdash;full of the barbarism that blood and tradition have
handed down from the beginning, and embalmed in its prejudices,
like the corpses of Egypt,&mdash;could not fail to be of incalculable
importance to philanthropists who regard no people as beyond
the reach of enlightenment.</p>

<p>The completed task rises before me like a moving panorama
whose scenery and background are the ocean and tropics, and
whose principal actor combines the astuteness of Fouch&eacute; with
the dexterity of Gil Blas. I have endeavored to set forth
his story as plainly as possible, letting events instead of descriptions
develope a chequered life which was incessantly connected
with desperate men of both colors. As he unmasked his
whole career, and gave me leave to use the incidents, I have not
dared to hide what the actor himself displayed no wish to conceal.
Besides the sketches of character which familiarize us
with the aboriginal negro in Africa, there is a good moral in the
resultless life, which, after all its toils, hazards, and successes
leaves the adventurer a stranded wreck in the prime of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg&nbsp;v]</a></span>
manhood. One half the natural capacity, employed industriously in
lawful commerce, would have made the captain comfortable and
independent. Nor is there much to attract in the singular abnegation
of civilized happiness in a slaver&rsquo;s career. We may not
be surprised, that such an <i>animal</i> as Da Souza, who is portrayed
in these pages, should revel in the sensualities of Dahomey; but
we must wonder at the passive endurance that could chain a superior
order of man, like Don Pedro Blanco, for fifteen unbroken
years, to his pestilential hermitage, till the avaricious
anchorite went forth from the marshes of Gallinas, laden with
gold. I do not think this story is likely to seduce or educate a
race of slavers!</p>

<p>The frankness of Canot&rsquo;s disclosures may surprise the more
reserved and timid classes of society; but I am of opinion that
there is an ethnographic value in the account of his visit to the
Mandingoes and Fullahs, and especially in his narrative of the
wars, jugglery, cruelty, superstition, and crime, by which one
sixth of Africa subjects the remaining five sixths to servitude.</p>

<p>As the reader peruses these characteristic anecdotes, he will
ask himself how,&mdash;in the progress of mankind,&mdash;such a people
is to be approached and dealt with? Will the Mahometanism
of the North which is winning its way southward, and infusing itself
among the crowds of central Africa, so as, in some degree, to
modify their barbarism, prepare the primitive tribes to receive
a civilization and faith which are as true as they are divine?
Will our colonial fringe spread its fibres from the coast to the
interior, and, like veins of refreshing blood, pour new currents
into the mummy&rsquo;s heart? Is there hope for a nation which, in
three thousand years, has hardly turned in its sleep? The identical
types of race, servitude, occupation, and character that are
now extant in Africa, may be found on the Egyptian monuments
built forty centuries ago; while a Latin poem, attributed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span>
Virgil, describes a menial negress who might unquestionably pass
for a slave of our Southern plantations:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Interdum clamat Cybalen; erat unica custos;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afra genus, tota patriam testante figura;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torta comam, labroque tumens, et fusca colorem;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pectore lata, jacens mammis, compressior alvo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cruribus exilis, spatiosa prodiga planta;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continuis rimis calcanea scissa rigebant.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will be seen from these hints that our memoir has nothing
to do with slavery as a North American institution, except so far
as it is an inheritance from the system it describes; yet, in proportion
as the details exhibit an innate or acquired inferiority of
the negro race <i>in its own land</i>, they must appeal to every generous
heart in behalf of the benighted continent.</p>

<p>It has lately become common to assert that Providence permits
<i>an exodus through slavery</i>, in order that the liberated
negro may in time return, and, with foreign acquirements, become
the pioneer of African civilization. It is attempted to
reconcile us to this &ldquo;good from evil,&rdquo; by stopping inquiry with
the &ldquo;inscrutability of God&rsquo;s ways!&rdquo; But we should not suffer
ourselves to be deceived by such imaginary irreverence; for, in
God&rsquo;s ways, there is nothing <i>less</i> inscrutable than his <i>law of right</i>.
That law is never qualified in this world. It moves with the
irresistible certainty of organized nature, and, while it makes
man free, in order that his responsibility may be unquestionable,
it leaves mercy, even, for the judgment hereafter. Such a system
of divine law can never palliate <i>the African slave trade</i>,
and, in fact, it is the basis of that human legislation which converts
the slaver into a pirate, and awards him a felon&rsquo;s doom.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we should discountenance schemes like
those proposed not long ago in England, and sanctioned by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg&nbsp;vii]</a></span>
British government, for the encouragement of spontaneous emigration
from Africa under the charge of <i>contractors</i>. The plan
was viewed with fear by the colonial authorities, and President
Roberts at once issued a proclamation to guard the natives.
No one, I think, will read this book without a conviction that
the idea of <i>voluntary expatriation</i> has not dawned on the African
mind, and, consequently, what might begin in laudable
philanthropy would be likely to end in practical servitude.</p>

<p>Intercourse, trade, and colonization, in slow but steadfast
growth, are the providences intrusted to us for the noble task
of civilization. They who are practically acquainted with the
colored race of our country, have long believed that gradual colonization
was the only remedy for Africa as well as America.
The repugnance of the free blacks to <i>emigration from our
shores</i> has produced a tardy movement, and thus the African
population has been thrown back grain by grain, and not wave
by wave. Every one conversant with the state of our colonies,
knows how beneficial this languid accretion has been. It moved
many of the most enterprising, thrifty, and independent. It
established a social nucleus from the best classes of American
colored people. Like human growth, it allowed the frame
to mature in muscular solidity. It gave immigrants time to
test the climate; to learn the habit of government in states as
well as in families; to acquire the bearing of freemen; to abandon
their imitation of the whites among whom they had lived;
and thus, by degrees, to consolidate a social and political system
which may expand into independent and lasting nationality.
Instead, therefore, of lamenting the slowness with which the colonies
have reached their vigorous promise, we should consider
it a blessing that the vicious did not rush forth in turbulent
crowds with the worthy, and impede the movements of better
folks, who were still unused to the task of self-reliance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg&nbsp;viii]</a></span>
Men are often too much in a hurry to do good, and mar by
excessive zeal what patience would complete. &ldquo;Deus quies quia
&aelig;ternus,&rdquo; saith St. Augustine. The cypress is a thousand years
in growth, yet its limbs touch not the clouds, save on a mountain
top. Shall the regeneration of a continent be quicker than
its ripening? That would be miracle&mdash;not progress.</p>

<p>Accept this offering, my dear Willis, as a token of that sincere
regard, which, during an intimacy of a quarter of a century,
has never wavered in its friendly trust.</p>

<p class="sig1">Faithfully, yours,</p>

<h1 style="padding-top: 3em;">THEODORE CANOT.</h1>



<h2 style="padding-top: 3em;">CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>Whilst Bonaparte was busy conquering Italy, my excellent
father, Louis Canot, a captain and paymaster in the French
army, thought fit to pursue his fortunes among the gentler sex
of that fascinating country, and luckily won the heart and hand
of a blooming Piedmontese, to whom I owe my birth in the capital
of Tuscany.</p>

<p>My father was faithful to the Emperor as well as the Consul.
He followed his sovereign in his disasters as well as glory: nor
did he falter in allegiance until death closed his career on the
field of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Soldiers&rsquo; wives are seldom rich, and my mother was no exception
to the rule. She was left in very moderate circumstances,
with six children to support; but the widow of an old
campaigner, who had partaken the sufferings of many a long and
dreary march with her husband, was neither disheartened by the
calamity, nor at a loss for thrifty expedients to educate her
younger offspring. Accordingly, I was kept at school, studying
geography, arithmetic, history and the languages, until near
twelve years old, when it was thought time for me to choose a
profession. At school, and in my leisure hours, I had always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg&nbsp;2]</a></span>
been a greedy devourer of books of travel, or historical narratives
full of stirring incidents, so that when I avowed my preference
for a sea-faring life, no one was surprised. Indeed, my
fancy was rather applauded, as two of my mother&rsquo;s brothers had
served in the Neapolitan navy, under Murat. Proper inquiries
were quickly made at Leghorn; and, in a few weeks, I found
myself on the <i>mole</i> of that noble seaport, comfortably equipped,
with a liberal outfit, ready to embark, as an apprentice, upon the
American ship Galatea, of Boston.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1819, that I first saluted the element upon
which it has been my destiny to pass so much of my life. The
reader will readily imagine the discomforts to which I was subjected
on this voyage. Born and bred in the interior of Italy,
I had only the most romantic ideas of the sea. My opinions
had been formed from the lives of men in loftier rank and under
more interesting circumstances. My career was necessarily one
of great hardship; and, to add to my misfortunes, I had neither
companion nor language to vent my grief and demand sympathy.
For the first three months, I was the butt of every joker in the
ship. I was the scape-goat of every accident and of every one&rsquo;s
sins or carelessness. As I lived in the cabin, each plate, glass,
or utensil that fell to leeward in a gale, was charged to my negligence.
Indeed, no one seemed to compassionate my lot save a
fat, lubberly negro cook, whom I could not endure. He was the
<i>first</i> African my eye ever fell on, and I must confess that he
was the only friend I possessed during my early adventures.</p>

<p>Besides the officers of the Galatea, there was a clerk on
board, whom the captain directed to teach me English, so that,
by the time we reached Sumatra, I was able to stand up for my
rights, and plead my cause. As we could not obtain a cargo of
pepper on the island, we proceeded to Bengal; and, on our arrival
at Calcutta, the captain, who was also supercargo, took apartments
on shore, where the clerk and myself were allowed to follow
him.</p>

<p>According to the fashion of that period, the house provided
for our accommodation was a spacious and elegant one, equipped
with every oriental comfort and convenience, while fifteen or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg&nbsp;3]</a></span>
twenty servants were always at the command of its inmates.
For three months we lived like nabobs, and sorry, indeed, was I
when the clerk announced that the vessel&rsquo;s loading was completed,
and our holiday over.</p>

<p>On the voyage home, I was promoted from the cabin, and
sent into the steerage to do duty as a &ldquo;light hand,&rdquo; in the chief
mate&rsquo;s watch. Between this officer and the captain there was
ill blood, and, as I was considered the master&rsquo;s pet, I soon began
to feel the bitterness of the subordinate&rsquo;s spite. This fellow
was not only cross-grained, but absolutely malignant. One day,
while the ship was skimming along gayly with a five-knot breeze,
he ordered me out to the end of the jib-boom to loosen the sail;
yet, without waiting until I was clear of the jib, he suddenly
commanded the men who were at the halliards to hoist the canvas
aloft. A sailor who stood by pointed out my situation, but
was cursed into silence. In a moment I was jerked into the air,
and, after performing half a dozen involuntary summersets, was
thrown into the water, some distance from the ship&rsquo;s side.
When I rose to the surface, I heard the prolonged cry of the
anxious crew, all of whom rushed to the ship&rsquo;s side, some with
ropes&rsquo; ends, some with chicken coops, while others sprang to the
stern boat to prepare it for launching. In the midst of the
hurly-burly, the captain reached the deck, and laid the ship to;
the sailor who had remonstrated with the mate having, in the
meantime, clutched that officer, and attempted to throw him
over, believing I had been drowned by his cruelty. As the sails
of the Galatea flattened against the wind, many an anxious eye
was strained over the water in search of me; but I was nowhere
seen! In truth, as the vessel turned on her heel, the movement
brought her so close to the spot where I rose, that I clutched a
rope thrown over for my rescue, and climbed to the lee channels
without being perceived. As I leaped to the deck, I found one
half the men in tumultuous assemblage around the struggling
mate and sailor; but my sudden apparition served to divert the
mob from its fell purpose, and, in a few moments, order was perfectly
restored. Our captain was an intelligent and just man,
as may be readily supposed from the fact that he exclusively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg&nbsp;4]</a></span>
controlled so valuable an enterprise. Accordingly, the matter
was examined with much deliberation; and, on the following
day, the chief mate was deprived of his command. I should not
forget to mention that, in the midst of the excitement, my sable
friend the cook leaped overboard to rescue his <i>proteg&eacute;</i>. Nobody
happened to notice the darkey when he sprang into the sea; and,
as he swam in a direction quite contrary from the spot where I
fell, he was nigh being lost, when the ship&rsquo;s sails were trimmed
upon her course. Just at that moment a faint call was heard
from the sea, and the woolly skull perceived in time for rescue.</p>

<p>This adventure elevated not only &ldquo;little Theodore,&rdquo; but our
&ldquo;culinary artist&rdquo; in the good opinion of the mess. Every Saturday
night my African friend was allowed to share the cheer
of the forecastle, while our captain presented him with a certificate
of his meritorious deed, and made the paper more palatable
by the promise of a liberal bounty in current coin at the end of
the voyage.</p>

<p>I now began to feel at ease, and acquire a genuine fondness
for sea life. My aptitude for languages not only familiarized me
with English, but enabled me soon to begin the scientific study
of navigation, in which, I am glad to say, that Captain Solomon
Towne was always pleased to aid my industrious efforts.</p>

<p>We touched at <span class="smcap">St. Helena</span> for supplies, but as Napoleon was
still alive, a British frigate met us within five miles of that rock-bound
coast, and after furnishing a scant supply of water, bade
us take our way homeward.</p>

<p>I remember very well that it was a fine night in July, 1820,
when we touched the wharf at Boston, Massachusetts. Captain
Towne&rsquo;s family resided in Salem, and, of course, he was soon on
his way thither. The new mate had a young wife in Boston, and
he, too, was speedily missing. One by one, the crew sneaked off
in the darkness. The second mate quickly found an excuse for
a visit in the neighborhood; so that, by midnight, the Galatea,
with a cargo valued at about one hundred and twenty thousand
dollars, was intrusted to the watchfulness of a stripling cabin-boy.</p>

<p>I do not say it boastfully, but it is true that, whenever I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span>
have been placed in responsible situations, from the earliest
period of my recollection, I felt an immediate stirring of that
pride which always made me equal, or at least willing, for the
required duty. All night long I paced the deck. Of all the
wandering crowd that had accompanied me nearly a year across
many seas, I alone had no companions, friends, home, or sweetheart,
to seduce me from my craft; and I confess that the sentiment
of loneliness, which, under other circumstances, might have
unmanned me at my American greeting, was stifled by the mingled
vanity and pride with which I trod the quarter-deck as temporary
captain.</p>

<p>When dawn ripened into daylight, I remembered the stirring
account my shipmates had given of the beauty of Boston, and I
suddenly felt disposed to imitate the example of my fellow-sailors.
Honor, however, checked my feet as they moved towards
the ship&rsquo;s ladder; so that, instead of descending her side, I
closed the cabin door, and climbed to the main-royal yard, to <i>see</i>
the city at least, if I could not mingle with its inhabitants. I
expected to behold a second Calcutta; but my fancy was not gratified.
Instead of observing the long, glittering lines of palaces
and villas I left in India and on the Tuscan shore, my Italian
eyes were first of all saluted by dingy bricks and painted boards.
But, as my sight wandered away from the town, and swept down
both sides of the beautiful bay, filled with its lovely islands, and
dressed in the fresh greenness of summer, I confess that my
memory and heart were magically carried away into the heart of
Italy, playing sad tricks with my sense of duty, when I was
abruptly restored to consciousness by hearing the heavy footfall
of a stranger on deck.</p>

<p>The intruder&mdash;as well as I could see from aloft&mdash;seemed to
be a stout, elderly person. I did not delay to descend the ratlins,
but slid down a back-stay, just in time to meet the stranger
as he approached our cabin. My notions of Italian manners
did not yet permit me to appreciate the greater freedom and
social liberty with which I have since become so familiar in
America, and it may naturally be supposed that I was rather
peremptory in ordering the inquisitive Bostonian to leave the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg&nbsp;6]</a></span>
ship. I was in command&mdash;in my <i>first</i> command; and so unceremonious
a visit was peculiarly annoying. Nor did the conduct
of the intruder lessen my anger, as, quietly smiling at my order,
he continued moving around the ship, and peered into every nook
and corner. Presently he demanded whether I was alone?
My self-possession was quite sufficient to leave the question unanswered;
but I ordered him off again, and, to enforce my command,
called a dog that did not exist. My <i>ruse</i>, however, did
not succeed. The Yankee still continued his examination, while
I followed closely on his heels, now and then twitching the long
skirts of his surtout to enforce my mandate for his departure.</p>

<p>During this promenade, my unwelcome guest questioned me
about the captain&rsquo;s health,&mdash;about the mate,&mdash;as to the cause of
his dismissal,&mdash;about our cargo,&mdash;and the length of our voyage.
Each new question begot a shorter and more surly answer. I
was perfectly satisfied that he was not only a rogue, but a most
impudent one; and my Franco-Italian temper strained almost to
bursting.</p>

<p>By this time, we approached the house which covered the
steering-gear at the ship&rsquo;s stern, and in which were buckets containing
a dozen small turtles, purchased at the island of Ascension,
where we stopped to water after the refusal at St. Helena.
The turtle at once attracted the stranger&rsquo;s notice, and he promptly
offered to purchase them. I stated that only half the lot belonged
to me, but that I would sell the whole, provided he
was able to pay. In a moment, my persecutor drew forth a well-worn
pocket-book, and handing me six dollars, asked whether I
was satisfied with the price. The dollars were unquestionable
gleams, if not absolute proofs, of honesty, and I am sure my
heart would have melted had not the purchaser insisted on taking
one of the buckets to convey the turtles home. Now, as these
charming implements were part of the ship&rsquo;s pride, as well as
property, and had been laboriously adorned by our marine artists
with a spread eagle and the vessel&rsquo;s name, I resisted the demand,
offering, at the same time, to return the money. But my turtle-dealer
was not to be repulsed so easily; his ugly smile still
sneered in my face as he endeavored to push me aside and drag
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span>
the bucket from my hand. I soon found that he was the stronger
of the two, and that it would be impossible for me to rescue my
bucket fairly; so, giving it a sudden twist and shake, I contrived
to upset both water and turtles on the deck, thus sprinkling the
feet and coat-tails of the veteran with a copious ablution. To
my surprise, however, the tormentor&rsquo;s cursed grin not only continued
but absolutely expanded to an immoderate laugh, the uproariousness
of which was increased by another suspicious Bostonian,
who leaped on deck during our dispute. By this time I was
in a red heat. My lips were white, my checks in a blaze, and my
eyes sparks. Beyond myself with ferocious rage, I gnashed my
teeth, and buried them in the hand which I could not otherwise
release from its grasp on the bucket. In the scramble, I either
lost or destroyed part of my bank notes; yet, being conqueror
at last, I became clement, and taking up my turtles, once more
insisted upon the departure of my annoyers. There is no doubt
that I larded my language with certain epithets, very current
among sailors, most of which are learned more rapidly by foreigners
than the politer parts of speech.</p>

<p>Still the abominable monster, nothing daunted by my onslaught,
rushed to the cabin, and would doubtless have descended,
had not I been nimbler than he in reaching the doors,
against which I placed my back, in defiance. Here, of course,
another battle ensued, enlivened by a chorus of laughter from a
crowd of laborers on the wharf. This time I could not bite, yet
I kept the apparent thief at bay with my feet, kicking his shins
unmercifully whenever he approached, and swearing in the choicest
Tuscan.</p>

<p>He who knows any thing of Italian character, especially when
it is additionally spiced by French condiments, may imagine the
intense rage to which so volcanic a nature as mine was, by this
time, fully aroused. Language and motion were nearly exhausted.
I could neither speak nor strike. The mind&rsquo;s passion had
almost produced the body&rsquo;s paralysis. Tears began to fall from
my eyes: but still he laughed! At length, I suddenly flung wide
the cabin doors, and leaping below at a bound, seized from the
rack a loaded musket, with which I rushed upon deck. As soon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
as the muzzle appeared above the hatchway, my tormentor sprang
over the ship, and by the time I reached the ladder, I found him
on the wharf, surrounded by a laughing and shouting crowd. I
shook my head menacingly at the group; and shouldering my
firelock, mounted guard at the gangway. It was fully a quarter
of an hour that I paraded (occasionally ramming home my musket&rsquo;s
charge, and varying the amusement by an Italian defiance
to the jesters), before the tardy mate made his appearance on
the wharf. But what was my consternation, when I beheld him
advance deferentially to my pestilent visitor, and taking off his
hat, respectfully offer to conduct him on board! This was a
great lesson to me in life on the subject of &ldquo;appearances.&rdquo; The
shabby old individual was no less a personage than the celebrated
William Gray, of Boston, owner of the Galatea and cargo, and
proprietor of many a richer craft then floating on every sea.</p>

<p>But Mr. Gray was a forgiving enemy. As he left the ship
that morning, he presented me fifty dollars, &ldquo;in exchange,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;for the six destroyed in protection of his property;&rdquo;
and, on the day of my discharge, he not only paid the wages of
my voyage, but added fifty dollars more to aid my schooling in
scientific navigation.</p>

<p>Four years after, I again met this distinguished merchant at
the Marlborough Hotel, in Boston. I was accompanied, on that
occasion, by an uncle who visited the United States on a commercial
tour. When my relative mentioned my name to Mr.
Gray, that gentleman immediately recollected me, and told my
venerable kinsman that he never received such abuse as I
bestowed on him in July, 1820! The sting of my teeth, he
declared, still tingled in his hand, while the kicks I bestowed
on his ankles, occasionally displayed the scars they had left on
his limbs. He seemed particularly annoyed, however, by some
caustic remarks I had made about his protuberant stomach, and
forgave the blows but not the language.</p>

<p>My uncle, who was somewhat of a tart disciplinarian, gave
me an extremely black look, while, in French, he demanded an
explanation of my conduct. I knew Mr. Gray, however, better
than my relative; and so, without heeding his reprimand, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
answered, in English, that if I cursed the ship&rsquo;s owner on that
occasion, it was my <i>debut</i> in the English language on the American
continent; and as my Anglo-Saxon education had been finished
in a forecastle, it was not to be expected I should be select
in my vocabulary. &ldquo;Never the less,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;Mr. Gray was
so delighted with my <i>accolade</i>, that he valued my defence of his
property and our delicious <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> at the sum of a hundred
dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>The anecdote told in the last chapter revived my uncle&rsquo;s recollection
of several instances of my early impetuosity; among
which was a rencounter with Lord Byron, while that poet was
residing at his villa on the slope of Monte Negro near Leghorn,
which he took the liberty to narrate to Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>A commercial house at that port, in which my uncle had some
interest, was the noble lord&rsquo;s banker;&mdash;and, one day, while my
relative and the poet were inspecting some boxes recently arrived
from Greece, I was dispatched to see them safely deposited in
the warehouse. Suddenly, Lord Byron demanded a pencil. My
uncle had none with him, but remembering that I had lately
been presented one in a handsome silver case, requested the
loan of it. Now, as this was my first <i>silver</i> possession, I was
somewhat reluctant to let it leave my possession even for a moment,
and handed it to his lordship with a bad grace. When the
poet had made his memorandum, he paused a moment, as if lost
in thought, and then very unceremoniously&mdash;but, doubtless, in a
fit of abstraction&mdash;put the pencil in his pocket. If I had already
visited America at that time, it is likely that I would have
warned the Englishman of his mistake on the spot; but, as
children in the Old World are rather more curbed in their intercourse
with elders than on this side of the Atlantic, I bore the
forgetfulness as well as I could until next morning. Summoning
all my resolution, I repaired without my uncle&rsquo;s knowledge to
the poet&rsquo;s house at an early hour, and after much difficulty was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
admitted to his room. He was still in bed. Every body has
heard of Byron&rsquo;s peevishness, when disturbed or intruded on.
He demanded my business in a petulant and offensive tone. I
replied, respectfully, that on the preceding day I loaned him a
<i>silver</i> pencil,&mdash;strongly emphasizing and repeating the word <i>silver</i>,&mdash;which,
I was grieved to say, he forgot to return. Byron reflected
a moment, and then declared he had restored it to me on the
spot! I mildly but firmly denied the fact; while his lordship
as sturdily reasserted it. In a short time, we were both in such
a passion that Byron commanded me to leave the room. I edged
out of the apartment with the slow, defying air of angry boyhood;
but when I reached the door, I suddenly turned, and
looking at him with all the bitterness I felt for his nation, called
him, in French, &ldquo;an English hog!&rdquo; Till then our quarrel had
been waged in Italian. Hardly were the words out of my mouth
when his lordship leaped from the bed, and in the scantiest drapery
imaginable, seized me by the collar, inflicting such a shaking
as I would willingly have exchanged for a tertian ague from the
Pontine marshes. The sudden air-bath probably cooled his
choler, for, in a few moments, we found ourselves in a pacific explanation
about the luckless pencil. Hitherto I had not mentioned
my uncle; but the moment I stated the relationship,
Byron became pacified and credited my story. After searching
his pockets once more ineffectually for the lost <i>silver</i>, he presented
me his own <i>gold</i> pencil instead, and requested me to say why
I &ldquo;cursed him <i>in French</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father was a Frenchman, my lord,&rdquo; said I.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is an Italian, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! no wonder, then, you called me an &lsquo;English hog.&rsquo;
The hatred runs in the blood; you could not help it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he continued,&mdash;still pacing the
apartment in his night linen,&mdash;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the English, do
you, my boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; returned Byron, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because my father died fighting them,&rdquo; replied I.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
&ldquo;Then, youngster, you have <i>a right</i> to hate them,&rdquo; said the
poet, as he put me gently out of the door, and locked it on the
inside.</p>

<p>A week after, one of the porters of my uncle&rsquo;s warehouse
offered to sell, at an exorbitant price, what he called &ldquo;Lord
Byron&rsquo;s pencil,&rdquo; declaring that his lordship had presented it to
him. My uncle was on the eve of bargaining with the man,
when he perceived his own initials on the silver. In fact, it was
my lost gift. Byron, in his abstraction, had evidently mistaken
the porter for myself; so the servant was rewarded with a trifling
gratuity, while my <i>virtuoso</i> uncle took the liberty to appropriate
the golden relic of Byron to himself, and put me off with the
humbler remembrance of his honored name.</p>

<p>These, however, are episodes. Let us return once more to
the Galatea and her worthy commander.</p>

<p>Captain Towne retired to Salem after the hands were discharged,
and took me with him to reside in his family until he
was ready for another voyage. In looking back through the vista
of a stormy and adventurous life, my memory lights on no happier
days than those spent in this sea-faring emporium. Salem,
in 1821, was my paradise. I received more kindness, enjoyed
more juvenile pleasures, and found more affectionate hospitality
in that comfortable city than I can well describe. Every boy
was my friend. No one laughed at my broken English, but on
the contrary, all seemed charmed by my foreign accent. People
thought proper to surround me with a sort of romantic mystery,
for, perhaps, there was a flavor of the dashing dare-devil in my
demeanor, which imparted influence over homelier companions.
Besides this, I soon got the reputation of a scholar. I was considered
a marvel in languages, inasmuch as I spoke French, Italian,
Spanish, English, and <i>professed</i> a familiarity with Latin. I
remember there was a wag in Salem, who, determining one day
to test my acquaintance with the latter tongue, took me into a
neighboring druggist&rsquo;s, where there were some Latin volumes,
and handed me one with the request to translate a page, either
verbally or on paper. Fortunately, the book he produced was
&AElig;sop, whose fables had been so thoroughly studied by me two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
years before, that I even knew some of them by heart. Still, as
I was not very well versed in the niceties of English, I thought
it prudent to make my version of the selected fable in French;
and, as there was a neighbor who knew the latter language perfectly,
my translation was soon rendered into English, and the
proficiency of the &ldquo;Italian boy&rdquo; conceded.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I sailed during five years from Salem on voyages to various
parts of the world, always employing my leisure, while on shore
and at sea, in familiarizing myself minutely with the practical
and scientific details of the profession to which I designed devoting
my life. I do not mean to narrate the adventures of those
early voyages, but I cannot help setting down a single anecdote
of that fresh and earnest period, in order to illustrate the
changes that time and &ldquo;<i>circumstances</i>&rdquo; are said to work on
human character.</p>

<p>In my second voyage to India, I was once on shore with the
captain at Quallahbattoo, in search of pepper, when a large <i>proa</i>,
or Malay canoe, arrived at the landing crammed with prisoners,
from one of the islands. The unfortunate victims were to be
sold <i>as slaves</i>. They were the <i>first slaves</i> I had seen! As the
human cargo was disembarked, I observed one of the Malays
dragging a handsome young female by the hair along the beach.
Cramped by long confinement in the wet bottom of the canoe,
the shrieking girl was unable to stand or walk. My blood was
up quickly. I ordered the brute to desist from his cruelty;
and, as he answered with a derisive laugh, I felled him to the
earth with a single blow of my boat-hook. This impetuous vindication
of humanity forced us to quit Quallahbattoo in great
haste; but, at the age of seventeen, my feelings in regard to
slavery were very different from what this narrative may disclose
them to have become in later days.</p>

<p>When my apprenticeship was over, I made two or three successful
voyages as mate, until&mdash;I am ashamed to say,&mdash;that a
&ldquo;disappointment&rdquo; caused me to forsake my employers, and to
yield to the temptations of reckless adventure. This sad and
early blight overtook me at Antwerp,&mdash;a port rather noted for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
the backslidings of young seamen. My hard-earned pay soon
diminished very sensibly, while I was desperately in love with
a Belgian beauty, who made a complete fool of me&mdash;for at least
three months! From Antwerp, I betook myself to Paris to vent
my second &ldquo;disappointment.&rdquo; The pleasant capital of <i>la belle
France</i> was a cup that I drained at a single draught. Few young
men of eighteen or twenty have lived faster. The gaming tables
at Frascati&rsquo;s and the Palais Royal finished my consumptive
purse; and, leaving an empty trunk as a recompense for my
landlord, I took &ldquo;French leave&rdquo; one fine morning, and hastened
to sea.</p>

<p>The reader will do me the justice to believe that nothing but
the direst necessity compelled me to embark on board a <i>British</i>
vessel, bound to Brazil. The captain and his wife who accompanied
him, were both stout, handsome Irish people, of equal
age, but addicted to fondness for strong and flavored drinks.</p>

<p>My introduction on board was signalized by the ceremonious
bestowal upon me of the key of the spirit-locker, with a strict
injunction from the commander to deny more than three glasses
daily either to his wife or himself. I hardly comprehended this
singular order at first, but, in a few days, I became aware of its
propriety. About eleven o&rsquo;clock her ladyship generally approached
when I was serving out the men&rsquo;s ration of gin, and
requested me to fill her tumbler. Of course, I gallantly complied.
When I returned from deck below with the bottle, she
again required a similar dose, which, with some reluctance, I furnished.
At dinner the dame drank <i>porter</i>, but passed off the
gin on her credulous husband as water. This system of deception
continued as long as the malt liquor lasted, so that her ladyship
received and swallowed daily a triple allowance of capital
grog. Indeed, it is quite astonishing what quantities of the
article can sometimes be swallowed by sea-faring <i>women</i>. The
oddness of their appetite for the cordials is not a little enhanced
by the well-known aversion the sex have to spirituous fluids, in
every shape, on shore. Perhaps the salt air may have something
to do with the acquired relish; but, as I am not composing an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
essay on temperance, I shall leave the discussion to wiser physiologists.</p>

<p>My companions&rsquo; indulgence illustrated another diversity between
the sexes, which I believe is historically true from the
earliest records to the present day. <i>The lady</i> broke her rule,
but <i>the captain</i> adhered faithfully to his. Whilst on duty, the
allotted three glasses completed his potations. But when we
reached Rio de Janeiro, and there was no longer need of abstinence,
save for the sake of propriety, both my shipmates gave
loose to their thirst and tempers. They drank, quarrelled, and
kissed, with more frequency and fervor than any creatures it has
been my lot to encounter throughout an adventurous life. After
we got the vessel into the inner harbor,&mdash;though not without
a mishap, owing to the captain&rsquo;s drunken stubbornness,&mdash;my Irish
friends resolved to take lodgings for a while on shore. For
two days they did not make their appearance; but toward the
close of the third, they returned, &ldquo;fresh,&rdquo; as they said, &ldquo;from
the theatre.&rdquo; It was very evident that the jolly god had been
their companion; and, as I was not a little scandalized by the
conjugal scenes which usually closed these frolics, I hastened to
order tea under the awning on deck, while I betook myself to a
hammock which was slung on the main boom. Just as I fell off
into pleasant dreams, I was roused from my nap by a prelude
to the opera. Madame gave her lord the lie direct. A loaf of
bread, discharged against her head across the table, was his
reply. Not content with this harmless demonstration of rage,
he seized the four corners of the table-cloth, and gathering the
tea-things and food in the sack, threw the whole overboard into
the bay. In a flash, the tigress fastened on his scanty locks
with one hand, while, with the other, she pummelled his eyes and
nose. Badly used as he was, I must confess that the captain
proved too generous to retaliate on that portion of his spouse
where female charms are most bewitching and visible; still, I
am much mistaken if the sound spanking she received did not
elsewhere leave marks of physical vigor that would have been
creditable to a pugilist.</p>

<p>It was remarkable that these human tornados were as violent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
and brief as those which scourge tropical lands as well as tropical
characters. In a quarter of an hour there was a dead calm.
The silence of the night, on those still and star-lit waters, was
only broken by a sort of chirrup, that might have been mistaken
for a cricket, but which I think was <i>a kiss</i>. Indeed, I was
rapidly going off again to sleep, when I was called to give the
key of the spirit-locker,&mdash;a glorious resource that never failed as
a solemn seal of reconciliation and bliss.</p>

<p>Next morning, before I awoke, the captain went ashore, and
when his wife, at breakfast, inquired my knowledge of the night&rsquo;s
affray, my gallantry forced me to confess that I was one of the
soundest sleepers on earth or water, and, moreover, that I was
surprised to learn there had been the least difference between
such happy partners. In spite of my simplicity, the lady insisted
on confiding her griefs, with the assurance that she would
not have been half so angry had not her spouse foolishly thrown
her silver spoons into the sea, with the bread and butter. She
grew quite eloquent on the pleasures of married life, and told me
of many a similar reproof she had been forced to give her husband
during their voyages. It did him good, she said, and kept
him wholesome. In fact, she hoped, that if ever I married, I
would have the luck to win a guardian like herself. Of course,
I was again most gallantly silent. Still, I could not help reserving
a decision as to the merits of matrimony; for present appearances
certainly did not demonstrate the bliss I had so often read
and heard of. At any rate, I resolved, that if ever I ventured
upon a trial of love, it should, at least, in the first instance, be
love <i>without</i> liquor!</p>

<p>On our return to Europe we called at Dover for orders, and
found that Antwerp was our destination. We made sail at sunset,
but as the wind was adverse and the weather boisterous, we
anchored for two days in the Downs. At length, during a lull
of the gale, we sailed for the mouth of the Scheldt; but, as we
approached the coast of Holland, the wind became light and
baffling, so that we were unable to enter the river. We had
not taken a pilot at Ramsgate, being confident of obtaining one
off Flushing. At sundown, the storm again arose in all its fury
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg&nbsp;17]</a></span>
from the north-west; but all attempts to put back to England
were unavailing, for we dared not show a rag of sail before the
howling tempest. It was, indeed, a fearful night of wind, hail,
darkness, and anxiety. At two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, we
suddenly grounded on one of the numerous banks off Flushing.
Hardly had we struck when the sea made a clean sweep over us,
covering the decks with sand, and snapping the spars like pipe-stems.
The captain was killed instantly by the fall of a top-gallant
yard, which crushed his skull; while the sailors, who in such
moments seem possessed by utter recklessness, broke into the
spirit-room and drank to excess. For awhile I had some hope
that the stanchness of our vessel&rsquo;s hull might enable us to cling
to her till daylight, but she speedily bilged and began to fill.</p>

<p>After this it would have been madness to linger. The boats
were still safe. The long one was quickly filled by the crew, under
the command of the second mate&mdash;who threw an anker of
gin into the craft before he leaped aboard,&mdash;while I reserved the
jolly-boat for myself, the captain&rsquo;s widow, the cook, and the steward.
The long-boat was never heard of.</p>

<p>All night long that dreadful nor&rsquo;wester howled along and
lashed the narrow sea between England and the Continent; yet
I kept our frail skiff before it, hoping, at daylight, to descry the
lowlands of Belgium. The heart-broken woman rested motionless
in the stern-sheets. We covered her with all the available
garments, and, even in the midst of our own griefs, could not
help feeling that the suddenness of her double desolation had
made her perfectly unconscious of our dreary surroundings.</p>

<p>Shortly after eight o&rsquo;clock a cry of joy announced the sight
of land within a short distance. The villagers of Bragden, who
soon descried us, hastened to the beach, and rushing knee deep
into the water, signalled that the shore was safe after passing the
surf. The sea was churned by the storm into a perfect foam.
Breakers roared, gathered, and poured along like avalanches.
Still, there was no hope for us but in passing the line of these
angry sentinels. Accordingly, I watched the swell, and pulling
firmly, bow on, into the first of the breakers, we spun with such
arrowy swiftness across the intervening space, that I recollect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
nothing until we were clasped in the arms of the brawny Belgians
on the beach.</p>

<p>But, alas! the poor widow was no more. I cannot imagine
when she died. During the four hours of our passage from the
wreck to land, her head rested on my lap; yet no spasm of pain
or convulsion marked the moment of her departure.</p>

<p>That night the parish priest buried the unfortunate lady, and
afterwards carried round a plate, asking alms,&mdash;not for masses to
insure the repose of her soul,&mdash;but to defray the expenses of
<i>the living</i> to Ostend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>I had no time or temper to be idle. In a week, I was on board
a Dutch galliot, bound to Havana; but I soon perceived that I
was again under the command of two captains&mdash;male and female.
The regular master superintended the navigation, while the
<i>bloomer</i> controlled the whole of us. Indeed, the dame was the
actual owner of the craft, and, from skipper to cabin-boy, governed
not only our actions but our stomachs. I know not
whether it was piety or economy that swayed her soul, but I
never met a person who was so rigid as this lady in the observance
of the church calendar, especially whenever a day of abstinence
allowed her to deprive us of our beef. Nothing but my
destitution compelled me to ship in this craft; still, to say the
truth, I had well-nigh given up all idea of returning to the
United States, and determined to engage in any adventurous expedition
that my profession offered. In 1824, it will be remembered,
Mexico, the Spanish main, Peru, and the Pacific coasts,
were renowned for the fortunes they bestowed on enterprise;
and, as the galliot was bound to Havana, I hailed her as a sort
of floating bridge to my <span class="smcap">El Dorado</span>.</p>

<p>On the seventh night after our departure, while beating out
of the bay of Biscay with a six-knot breeze, in a clear moonlight,
we ran foul of a vessel which approached us on the opposite tack.
Whence she sprang no one could tell. In an instant, she appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
and was on us with a dreadful concussion. Every man was
prostrated on deck and all our masts were carried away. From
the other vessel we heard shrieks and a cry of despair; but the
ill-omened miscreant disappeared as rapidly as she approached,
and left us floating a helpless log, on a sea proverbial for storms.</p>

<p>We contrived, however, to reach the port of Ferrol, in
Spain, where we were detained four months, in consequence of the
difficulty of obtaining the materials for repairs, notwithstanding
this place is considered the best and largest ship-yard of Castile.</p>

<p>It was at Ferrol that I met with a singular adventure, which
was well-nigh depriving me of my personal identity, as Peter
Schlemhil was deprived of his shadow. I went one afternoon in
my boat to the other side of the harbor to obtain some pieces of
leather from a tannery, and, having completed my purchase, was
lounging slowly towards the quay, when I stopped at a house for
a drink of water. I was handed a tumbler by the trim-built,
black-eyed girl, who stood in the doorway, and whose rosy lips
and sparkling eyes were more the sources of my thirst than the
water; but, while I was drinking, the damsel ran into the dwelling,
and hastily returned with her mother and another sister,
who stared at me a moment without saying a word, and simultaneously
fell upon my neck, smothering my lips and cheeks
with repeated kisses!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Oh! mi querido hijo</i>,&rdquo; said the mother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Carissimo Antonio</i>,&rdquo; sobbed the daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mi hermano!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear son, dear Antonio, dear brother! Come into the
house; where have you been? Your grandmother is dying to
see you once more! Don&rsquo;t delay an instant, but come in without
a word! <i>Por dios!</i> that we should have caught you at last, and
in such a way: <i>Ave Maria! madrecita, aqui viene Antonito!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the midst of all these exclamations, embraces, fondlings,
and kisses, it may easily be imagined that I stood staring about
me with wide eyes and mouth, and half-drained tumbler in hand,
like one in a dream. I asked no questions, but as the dame was
buxom, and the girls were fresh, I kissed in return, and followed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
unreluctantly as they half dragged, half carried me into their
domicil. On the door-sill of the inner apartment I found myself
locked in the skinny arms of a brown and withered crone, who
was said to be my grandmother, and, of course, my youthful
<i>moustache</i> was properly bedewed with the moisture of her
toothless mouth.</p>

<p>As soon as I was seated, I took the liberty to say,&mdash;though
without any protest against this charming assault,&mdash;that I
fancied there might possibly be some mistake; but I was
quickly silenced. My <i>madrecita</i> declared at once, and in the
presence of my four shipmates, that, six years before, I left her
on my first voyage in a Dutch vessel; that my <i>querido padre</i>,
had gone to bliss two years after my departure; and, accordingly,
that now, I, Antonio Gomez y Carrasco, was the only surviving
male of the family, and, of course, would never more quit
either her, my darling sisters, or the old <i>pobrecita</i>, our grandmother.
This florid explanation was immediately closed like the
pleasant air of an opera by a new chorus of kisses, nor can
there be any doubt that I responded to the embraces of my sweet
<i>hermanas</i> with the most gratifying fraternity.</p>

<p>Our charming <i>quartette</i> lasted in all its harmony for half an
hour, during which volley after volley of family secrets was discharged
into my eager ears. So rapid was the talk, and so
quickly was its thread taken up and spun out by each of the
three, that I had no opportunity to interpose. At length,
however, in a momentary lull and in a jocular manner,&mdash;but in
rather bad Spanish,&mdash;I ventured to ask my loving and talkative
mamma, &ldquo;what amount of property my worthy father had deemed
proper to leave on earth <i>for his son</i> when he took his departure
to rest <i>con Dios</i>?&rdquo; I thought it possible that this agreeable
drama was a Spanish joke, got up <i>al&rsquo; improvista</i>, and that I
might end it by exploding the dangerous mine of money: besides
this, it was growing late, and my return to the galliot was
imperative.</p>

<p>But alas! my question brought tears in an instant into my
mother&rsquo;s eyes, and I saw that the scene was <i>not</i> a jest. Accordingly,
I hastened, in all seriousness, to explain and insist on their error.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
I protested with all the force of my Franco-Italian nature and
Spanish rhetoric, against the assumed relationship. But all
was unavailing; they argued and persisted; they brought in the
neighbors; lots of old women and old men, with rusty cloaks or
shawls, with cigars or <i>cigarillos</i> in mouth, formed a jury of
inquest; so that, in the end, there was an unanimous verdict in
favor of my Galician nativity!</p>

<p>Finding matters had indeed taken so serious a turn, and knowing
the impossibility of eradicating an impression from the female
mind when it becomes imbedded with go much apparent conviction,
I resolved to yield; and, assuming the manner of a
penitent prodigal, I kissed the girls, embraced my mother,
passed my head over both shoulders of my grand-dame, and
promised my progenitors a visit next day.</p>

<p>As I did not keep my word, and two suns descended without
my return, the imaginary &ldquo;mother&rdquo; applied to the ministers of
law to enforce her rights over the truant boy. The <i>Alcalde</i>,
after hearing my story, dismissed the claim; but my dissatisfied
relatives summoned me, on appeal, before the governor of the
district, nor was it without infinite difficulty that I at last
succeeded in shaking off their annoying consanguinity.</p>

<p>I have always been at a loss to account for this queer mistake.
It is true that my father was in Spain with the French
army during Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion, but that excellent gentleman
was a faithful spouse as well as valiant soldier, and I do not
remember that he ever sojourned in the pleasant port of Ferrol!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>At length, we sailed for Havana, and nothing of importance
occurred to break the monotony of our hot and sweltering voyage,
save a sudden flurry of jealousy on the part of the captain, who
imagined I made an attempt to conquer the pious and economical
heart of his wife! In truth, nothing was further from my mind
or taste than such an enterprise; but as the demon had complete
possession of him, and his passion was stimulated by the lies of
a cabin-boy, I was forced to undergo an inquisitorial examination,
which I resisted manfully but fruitlessly. The Bloomer-dame,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg&nbsp;23]</a></span>
who knew her man, assumed such an air of outraged
innocence and calumniated virtue, interlarded with sobs, tears,
and hysterics, that her perplexed husband was quite at his wit&rsquo;s
end, but terminated the scene by abruptly ordering me to my
state-room.</p>

<p>This was at nightfall. I left the cabin willingly but with
great mortification; yet the surly pair eyed each other with
so much anger that I had some fear for the <i>denouement</i>. I
know not what passed during the silent watches of that night;
but doubtless woman&rsquo;s witchcraft had much to do in pouring oil
on the seared heart of the skipper. At daylight he emerged
from his cabin with orders to have the tell-tale cabin-boy
soundly thrashed; and, when Madame mounted the deck, I saw
at a glance that her influence was completely restored. Nor
was I neglected in this round of reconciliation. In the course
of the day, I was requested to resume my duty on board, but I
stubbornly refused. Indeed, my denial caused the captain great
uneasiness, for he was a miserable navigator, and, now that we
approached the Bahamas, my services were chiefly requisite.
The jealous scamp was urgent in desiring me to forget the past
and resume duty; still I declined, especially as his wife informed
me in private that there would perhaps be peril in my compliance.</p>

<p>The day after we passed the &ldquo;Hole in the Wall&rdquo; and steered
for Salt Key, we obtained no meridian observation, and no one
on board, except myself, was capable of taking a lunar, which in
our position, among unknown keys and currents, was of the
greatest value. I knew this troubled the skipper, yet, after his
wife&rsquo;s significant warning, I did not think it wise to resume my
functions. Nevertheless, I secretly made calculations and
watched the vessel&rsquo;s course. Another day went by without a
noontide observation; but, at midnight, I furtively obtained a
lunar, by the result of which I found we were drifting close to
the Cuba reefs, about five miles from the <span class="smcap">Cruz del Padre</span>.</p>

<p>As soon as I was sure of my calculation and sensible of imminent
danger, I did not hesitate to order the second officer,&mdash;whose
watch it was,&mdash;to call all hands and tack ship. At the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
same time, I directed the helmsman to luff the galliot close into
the wind&rsquo;s eye.</p>

<p>But the new mate, proud of his command, refused to obey
until the captain was informed; nor would he call that officer,
inasmuch as no danger was visible ahead on the allotted course.
But time was precious. Delay would lose us. As I felt confident
of my opinion, I turned abruptly from the disobedient
mariners, and letting go the main brace, brought the vessel to
with the topsail aback. Quickly, then, I ordered the watch as
it rushed aft, to clew up the mainsail;&mdash;but alas! no one would
obey; and, in the fracas, the captain, who rushed on deck ignorant
of the facts or danger, ordered me back to my state-room
with curses for my interference in his skilful navigation.</p>

<p>With a shrug of my shoulders, I obeyed. Remonstrance was
useless. For twenty minutes the galliot cleft the waters on her
old course, when the look-out screamed: &ldquo;Hard up!&mdash;rocks and
breakers dead ahead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put down the helm!&rdquo; yelled the confused second mate;&mdash;but
the galliot lost her headway, and, taken aback, shaved the
edge of a foam-covered rock, dropping astern on a reef with
seven feet water around her.</p>

<p>All was consternation;&mdash;sails flapping; breakers roaring;
ropes snapping and beating; masts creaking; hull thumping;
men shouting! The captain and his wife were on deck in the
wink of an eye. Every one issued an order and no one obeyed.
At last, <i>the lady</i> shouted&mdash;&ldquo;let go the anchor!&rdquo;&mdash;the worst
command that could be given,&mdash;and down went the best bower
and the second anchor, while the vessel swung round, and dashed
flat on both of them. No one seemed to think of clewing up the
sails, and thereby lessening the impetuous surges of the unfortunate
galliot.</p>

<p>Our sad mishap occurred about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.
Fortunately there was not much wind and the sea was tolerably
calm, so that we could recognize, and, in some degree, control
our situation;&mdash;yet, every thing on board appeared given over
to Batavian stupidity and panic.</p>

<p>My own feelings may be understood by those who have calmly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
passed through danger, while they beheld their companions unmanned
by fear or lack of coolness. There was no use of my interference,
for no one would heed me. At last the captain&rsquo;s wife,
who was probably the most collected individual on board, called
my name loudly, and in the presence of officers and crew, who,
by this time were generally crowded on the quarter-deck, entreated
me to save her ship!</p>

<p>Of course, I sprang to duty. Every sail was clewed up,
while the anchors were weighed to prevent our thumping on
them. I next ordered the boats to be lowered; and, taking a
crew in one, directed the captain to embark in another to seek an
escape from our perilous trap. At daylight, we ascertained that
we had crossed the edge of the reef at high water, yet it would
be useless to attempt to force her back, as she was already half a
foot buried in the soft and mushy outcroppings of coral.</p>

<p>Soon after sunrise, we beheld, at no great distance, one of
those low sandy keys which are so well-known to West Indian
navigators; while, further in the distance, loomed up the blue
and beautiful outline of the highlands of Cuba. The sea was
not much ruffled by swell or waves; but as we gazed at the key,
which we supposed deserted, we saw a boat suddenly shoot from
behind one of its points and approach our wreck. The visitors
were five in number; their trim, beautiful boat was completely
furnished with fishing implements, and four of the hands spoke
Spanish only, while the <i>patron</i>, or master, addressed us in French.
The whole crew were dressed in flannel shirts, the skirts of which
were belted by a leather strap over their trowsers, and when the
wind suddenly dashed the flannel aside, I saw they had long
knives concealed beneath it.</p>

<p>The <i>patron</i> of these fellows offered to aid us in lightening the
galliot and depositing the cargo on the key; where, he said, there
was a hut in which he would guarantee the safety of our merchandise
until, at the full of the moon, we could float the vessel from
the reef. He offered, moreover, to pilot us out of harm&rsquo;s way;
and, for all his services in salvage, we were to pay him a thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>While the master was busy making terms, his companions were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
rummaging the galliot in order to ascertain our cargo and armament.
It was finally agreed by the captain and his petticoat
commodore, that if, by evening and the return of tide, our galliot
would not float, we would accept the wreckers&rsquo; offer; and,
accordingly, I was ordered to inform them of the resolution.</p>

<p>As soon as I stated our assent, the <i>patron</i>, suddenly assumed
an air of deliberation, and insisted that the money should be
paid in hard cash on the spot, and not by drafts on Havana, as
originally required. I thought the demand a significant one, and
hoped the joint partners would neither yield nor admit their
ability to do so; but, unfortunately, they assented at once. The
nod and wink I saw the <i>patron</i> immediately bestow on one of
his companions, satisfied me of the imprudence of the concession
and the justice of my suspicions.</p>

<p>The fishermen departed to try their luck on the sea, promising
to be back at sunset, on their way to the island. We
spent the day in fruitless efforts to relieve the galliot or to find
a channel, so that when the Spaniards returned in the afternoon
with a rather careless reiteration of their proposal, our captain,
with some eagerness, made his final arrangements for the cargo&rsquo;s
discharge early next morning. Our skipper had visited the key
in the course of the day, and finding the place of deposit apparently
safe, and every thing else seemingly honest, he was anxious
that the night might pass in order that the disembarkation
might begin.</p>

<p>The calm quiet of that tropic season soon wore away, and,
when I looked landward, at day-dawn, I perceived two strange
boats at anchor near the key. As this gave me some uneasiness,
I mentioned it to the captain and his wife, but they laughed at
my suspicions. After an early meal we began to discharge our
heaviest cargo with the fishermen&rsquo;s aid, yet we made little progress
towards completion by the afternoon. At sunset, accounts
were compared, and finding a considerable difference <i>in favor</i>
of the wreckers, I was dispatched ashore to ascertain the error.
At the landing I was greeted by several new faces. I particularly
observed a Frenchman whom I had not noticed before. He
addressed me with a courteous offer of refreshments. His
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
manners and language were evidently those of an educated person,
while his figure and physiognomy indicated aristocratic habits or
birth, yet his features and complexion bore the strong imprint
of that premature old age which always marks a dissipated career.</p>

<p>After a delightful chat in my mother-tongue with the pleasant
stranger, he invited me to spend the night on shore. I declined
politely, and, having rectified the cargo&rsquo;s error, was preparing to
re-embark, when the Frenchman once more approached and insisted
on my remaining. I again declined, asserting that duty forbade
my absence. He then remarked that orders had been left
by my countryman the <i>patron</i> to detain me; but if I was so obstinate
as to go, <i>I might probably regret it</i>.</p>

<p>With a laugh, I stepped into my boat, and on reaching the
galliot, learned that our skipper had imprudently avowed the rich
nature of our cargo.</p>

<p>Before leaving the vessel that night, the <i>patron</i> took me
aside, and inquired whether I received the invitation to pass the
night on the key, and why I had not accepted it? To my great
astonishment, he addressed me in pure Italian; and when I expressed
gratitude for his offer, he beset me with questions about
my country, my parents, my age, my objects in life, and my
prospects. Once or twice he threw in the ejaculation of, &ldquo;poor
boy! poor boy!&rdquo; As he stepped over the taffrail to enter his
boat, I offered my hand, which he first attempted to take,&mdash;then
suddenly stopping, rejected the grasp, and, with an abrupt&mdash;&ldquo;<i>No!
addio!</i>&rdquo; he spun away in his boat from the galliot&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>I could not help putting these things together in my mind
during the glowing twilight. I felt as if walking in a cold
shadow; an unconquerable sense of impending danger oppressed
me. I tried to relieve myself by discussing the signs with the
captain, but the phlegmatic Hollander only scoffed at my suspicions,
and bade me sleep off my nervousness.</p>

<p>When I set the first night watch, I took good care to place
every case containing valuables <i>below</i>, and to order the look-out
to call all hands at the first appearance or sound of a boat. Had
we been provided with arms, I would have equipped the crew
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg&nbsp;28]</a></span>
with weapons of defence, but, unluckily, there was not on board
even a rusty firelock or sabre.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>How wondrously calm was all nature that night! Not a
breath of air, or a ripple on the water! The sky was brilliant
with stars, as if the firmament were strewn with silver dust.
The full moon, with its glowing disc, hung some fifteen or twenty
degrees above the horizon. The intense stillness weighed upon
my tired limbs and eyes, while I leaned with my elbows on the
taffrail, watching the roll of the vessel as she swung lazily from
side to side on the long and weary swell. Every body but the
watch had retired, and I, too, went to my state-room in hope of
burying my sorrows in sleep. But the calm night near the land
had so completely filled my berth with annoying insects, that I was
obliged to decamp and take refuge in the stay-sail netting, where,
wrapped in the cool canvas, I was at rest in quicker time than I
have taken to tell it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my nervous apprehension, a sleep more like
the torpor of lethargy than natural slumber, fell on me at once.
I neither stirred nor heard any thing till near two o&rsquo;clock, when
a piercing shriek from the deck aroused me. The moon had set,
but there was light enough to show the decks abaft filled with
men, though I could distinguish neither their persons nor movements.
Cries of appeal, and moans as of wounded or dying,
constantly reached me. I roused myself as well and quickly as
I could from the oppression of my deathlike sleep, and tried to
shake off the nightmare. The effort assured me that it was
reality and not a dream! In an instant, that presence of mind
which has seldom deserted me, suggested escape. I seized the
gasket, and dropping by aid of it as softly as I could in the
water, struck out for shore. It was time. My plunge into the
sea, notwithstanding its caution, had made some noise, and a
rough voice called in Spanish to return or I would be shot.</p>

<p>When I began to go to sea, I took pains to become a good
swimmer, and my acquired skill served well on this occasion.
As soon as the voice ceased from the deck, I lay still on the
water until I saw a flash from the bow of the <i>galliot</i>, to which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
immediately made a complaisant bow by diving deeply. This
operation I repeated several times, till I was lost in the distant
darkness; nor can I pride myself much on my address in escaping
the musket balls, as I have since had my own aim similarly
eluded by many a harmless duck.</p>

<p>After swimming about ten minutes, I threw myself on my
back to rest and &ldquo;take a fresh departure.&rdquo; It was so dark that
I could not see the key, yet, as I still discerned the galliot&rsquo;s
masts relieved against the sky, I was enabled by that beacon to
steer my way landward. Naked, with the exception of trowsers,
I had but little difficulty in swimming, so that in less than half
an hour, I touched the key, and immediately sought concealment
in a thick growth of mangroves.</p>

<p>I had not been five minutes in this dismal jungle, when such
a swarm of mosquitoes beset me, that I was forced to hurry to the
beach and plunge into the water. In this way was I tormented
the whole night. At dawn, I retreated once more to the bushes;
and climbing the highest tree I found,&mdash;whose altitude, however,
was not more than twelve feet above the sand,&mdash;I beheld, across
the calm sea, the dismantled hull of my late home, surrounded
by a crowd of boats, which were rapidly filling with plundered
merchandise. It was evident that we had fallen a prey to
pirates; yet I could not imagine why <i>I</i> had been singled from
this scene of butchery, to receive the marks of anxious sympathy
that were manifested by the <i>patron</i> and his French companion on
the key. All the morning I continued in my comfortless position,
watching their movements,&mdash;occasionally refreshing my parched
lips by chewing the bitter berries of the thicket. Daylight, with
its heat, was as intolerable as night, with its venom. The tropical
sun and the glaring reflection from a waveless sea, poured through
the calm atmosphere upon my naked flesh, like boiling oil. My
thirst was intense. As the afternoon wore away, I observed several
boats tow the lightened hull of our galliot south-east of the
key till it disappeared behind a point of the island. Up to that
moment, my manhood had not forsaken me; but, as the last timber
of my vessel was lost to sight, nature resumed its dominion.
Every hope of seeing my old companions was gone; I was utterly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
alone. If this narrative were designed to be a sentimental confession,
the reader might see unveiled the ghastly spectacle of a
&ldquo;troubled conscience,&rdquo; nor am I ashamed to say that no consolation
cheered my desolate heart, till I prayed to my Maker that
the loss of so many lives might not be imputed to the wilful
malice of a proud and stubborn nature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>So passed the day. As the sun sank is the west, I began to reflect
about obtaining the rest for mind and body I so much
needed. My system was almost exhausted by want of food and
water, while the dreadful tragedy of the preceding night shattered
my nerves far more than they ever suffered amid the trying
scenes I have passed through since. It was my <i>first</i> adventure
of peril and of blood; and my soul shrank with the natural
recoil that virtue experiences in its earliest encounter with flagrant
crime.</p>

<p>In order to escape the incessant torment of insects, I had
just determined to bury my naked body in the sand, and to
cover my head with the only garment I possessed, when I heard
a noise in the neighboring bushes, and perceived a large and savage
dog rushing rapidly from side to side, with his nose to the
ground, evidently in search of game or prey. I could not mistake
the nature of his hunt. With the agility of a harlequin, I sprang
to my friendly perch just in time to save myself from his fangs.
The foiled and ferocious beast, yelling with rage, gave an alarm
which was quickly responded to by other dogs, three of which&mdash;followed
by two armed men&mdash;promptly made their appearance
beneath my tree. The hunters were not surprised at finding me,
as, in truth, I was the game they sought. Ordering me down, I
was commanded to march slowly before them, and especially
warned to make no attempt at flight, as the bloodhounds would
tear me to pieces on the spot. I told my guard that I should
of course manifest no such folly as to attempt as escape from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
<i>caballeros</i> like themselves,&mdash;upon a desolate sand key half a mile
wide,&mdash;especially when my alternative refuge could only be found
among the fish of the sea. The self-possession and good humor
with which I replied, seemed somewhat to mollify the cross-grained
savages, and we soon approached a habitation, where I
was ordered to sit down until the whole party assembled. After
a while, I was invited to join them in their evening meal.</p>

<p>The piquant stew upon which we fed effectually loosened
their tongues, so that, in the course of conversation, I discovered
my pursuers had been in quest of me since early morning, though
it was hardly believed I had either escaped the shot, or swam
fully a mile amid sharks during the darkness. Upon this, I ventured
to put some ordinary questions, but was quickly informed
that inquisitiveness was considered very unwholesome on the
sand keys about Cuba!</p>

<p>At sunset, the whole piratical community of the little isle was
assembled. It consisted of two parties, each headed by its respective
chief. Both gangs were apparently subject to the leadership
of the <i>rancho&rsquo;s</i> proprietor; and in this man I recognized the <i>patron</i>
who inquired so minutely about my biography and prospects.
His companions addressed him either as &ldquo;El se&ntilde;or patron&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Don Rafael.&rdquo; I was surveyed very closely by the picturesque
group of bandits, who retired into the interior of the <i>rancho</i>,&mdash;a
hut made of planks and sails rescued from wrecks. My
guard or sentinel consisted of but a single vagabond, who amused
himself by whetting a long knife on a hone, and then trying its
sharpness on a single hair and then on his finger. Sometimes
the scoundrel made a face at me, and drew the back of his weapon
across his throat.</p>

<p>The conversation within, which I felt satisfied involved my
fate, was a long one. I could distinctly overhear the murmuring
roar of talk, although I could not distinguish words. One sentence,
however, did not escape me, and its signification proved
particularly interesting:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Los muertos</i>,&rdquo; said the French dandy,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>no
hablan</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;Dead men tell no tales!</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine a situation more trying for a young,
hearty, and hopeful man. I was half naked; my skin was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span>
excoriated by the sun, sand, and salt water; four bloodhounds were
at my feet ready to fasten on my throat at the bidding of a
<i>desperado</i>; a piratical sentry, knife in hand, kept watch over me,
while a jury of <i>buccaneers</i> discussed my fate within earshot.
Dante&rsquo;s Inferno had hardly more torments.</p>

<p>The <i>filibustero</i> conclave lasted quite an hour without reaching
a conclusion. At length, after an unusual clamor, the <i>patron</i>
Rafael rushed from the <i>rancho</i> with a horseman&rsquo;s pistol, and,
calling my name, whirled me behind him in his strong and irresistible
grasp. Then facing both hands, with a terrible imprecation,
he swore vengeance if they persisted in requiring the death
of <span class="smcap lowercase">HIS NEPHEW</span>!</p>

<p>At the mention of the word &ldquo;<i>nephew</i>,&rdquo; every one paused
with a look of surprise, and drawing near the excited man with
expressions of interest, agreed to respect his new-found relative,
though they insisted I should swear never to disclose the occurrence
of which I had been an unwilling witness. I complied
with the condition unhesitatingly, and shook hands with every
one present except the sentry, of whom I shall have occasion to
speak hereafter.</p>

<p>It is astonishing what revulsions of manner, if not of feeling,
take place suddenly among the class of men with whom my lot
had now been cast. Ten minutes before, they were greedy for
my blood, not on account of personal malice, but from utter
recklessness of life whenever an individual interfered with their
personal hopes or tenure of existence. Each one of these outlaws
now vied with his companions in finding articles to cover my
nakedness and make me comfortable. As soon as I was clothed,
supper was announced and I was given almost a seat of honor at
a table plentifully spread with fresh fish, sardines, olives, ham,
cheese, and an abundance of capital claret.</p>

<p>The chat naturally turned upon me, and some sly jokes were
uttered at the expense of Rafael, concerning the kinsman who
had suddenly sprung up like a mushroom out of this pool of
blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Caballeros!</i>&rdquo; interposed Rafael, passionately, &ldquo;you seem
inclined to doubt my word. Perhaps you are no longer disposed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
to regard me as your chief? We have broken bread together
during four months; we have shared the same dangers and
divided our spoils fairly: am I <i>now</i> to be charged to my face
with a lie?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said he, rising from the table and striding
through the apartment with violent gestures, &ldquo;who dares doubt
my word, and impute to me the meanness of a lie? Are ye
drunk? Can this wine have made you mad?&rdquo; and seizing a
bottle, he dashed it to the ground, stamping with rage. &ldquo;Has the
blood of last night unsettled your nerves and made you delirious?
<i>Basta! basta!</i> Let me not hear another word of doubt
as to this youth. The first who utters a syllable of incredulity
shall kill me on the spot or fall by my hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sounds, I confess, very melo-dramatically, yet, my
experience has taught me that it is precisely a bold and dashing
tone of bravado, adopted at the right moment, which is
always most successful among <i>such</i> ruffians as surrounded my
preserver. The speech was delivered with such genuine vehemence
and resolution that no one could question his sincerity or
suppose him acting. But, as soon as he was done, the leader of
the other gang, who had been very unconcernedly smoking his
cigar, and apparently punctuating Don Rafael&rsquo;s oration with his
little puffs, advanced to my new uncle, and laying his hand on
his arm, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Amigo</i>, you take a joke too seriously. No one here certainly
desires to harm the boy or disbelieve you. Take my advice,&mdash;calm
yourself, light a cigarillo, drink a tumbler of claret, and
drop the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this process of pacification was too rapid for my excited
uncle. Men of his quality require to be let down gradually from
their wrath, for I have frequently noticed that when their object
is too easily gained, they interpose obstacles and start new subjects
of controversy, so that the most amiable and yielding temper
may at last become inflamed to passionate resistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, <i>caballeros</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed Don Rafael, &ldquo;I will neither
light a <i>cigarillo</i>, drink claret, calm myself, nor accept satisfaction
for this insult, short of the self-condemnation you will all experience
for a mean suspicion, when I <i>prove</i> the truth of my assertions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
about this boy. A doubted man has no business at the
head of such fellows as you are. Begone out of my hearing,
Theodore,&rdquo; continued he, pointing to the canvas door, &ldquo;begone
till I convince these people that I am your uncle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as I was out of the chamber, I afterwards learned,
that Rafael announced my name, place of birth, and parentage to
the wreckers, and desired the other <i>patron</i>, Mesclet, who spoke
Italian, to follow and interrogate me as to his accuracy.</p>

<p>Mesclet performed the service in a kind manner, opening the
interview by asking the names of my father and mother, and
then demanding how many uncles I had on my mother&rsquo;s side?
My replies appeared satisfactory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was one of your uncles a navy officer?&rdquo; inquired Mesclet,
&ldquo;and where is he at present?&rdquo; The only uncle I had in the
navy, I declared, had long been absent from his family. But
once in my life had I seen him, and that was while on his way
to Marseilles, in 1815, to embark for the Spanish main; since
then no intelligence of the wanderer had reached my ears. Had
I been a French <i>scholar</i> at that time, my adventures of consanguinity
at Ferrol and on this key might well have brought Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s
satire to my mind:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;De moi je commence &agrave; douter tout de bon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pourtant, quand je me t&acirc;te et que je me rapelle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Il me semble que je suis moi!</i>&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Mesclet&rsquo;s report gave perfect satisfaction to the scoffers, and
the mysterious drama at once established me in a position I
could not have attained even by desperate services to the <i>filibusteros</i>.
A bumper, all round, closed the night; and each slunk
off to his cot or blanket beneath a mosquito bar, while the bloodhounds
were chained at the door to do double duty as sentinels
and body-guard.</p>

<p>I hope there are few who will deny me the justice to believe
that when I stretched my limbs on the hard couch assigned me
that night, I remembered my God in heaven, and my home in
Tuscany. It was the first night that an ingenuous youth had
spent among outcasts, whose hands were still reeking with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
blood of his companions. At that period of manhood we are
grateful for the mere boon of <i>life</i>. It is pleasant to live, to
breathe, to have one&rsquo;s being, on this glorious earth, even though
that life may be cast among felons. There is still a <i>future</i> before
us; and Hope, the bright goddess of health and enthusiasm, inspires
our nerves with energy to conquer our present ills.</p>

<p>I threw myself down thankfully, but I could not rest. Sore
and tired as I was, I could not compose my mind to sleep. The
conduct of Rafael surprised me. I could not imagine how he
became familiar with my biography, nor could I identify his personal
appearance with my uncle who went so long before to South
America. A thousand fancies jumbled themselves in my brain,
and, in their midst, I fell into slumber. Yet my self-oblivion
was broken and short. My pulse beat wildly, but my skin did
not indicate the heat of fever. The tragedy of the galliot was
reacted before me. Phantoms of the butchered wife and men,
streaming with blood, stood beside my bed, while a chorus of
devils, in the garb of sailors, shouted that <i>I</i> was the cause of
the galliot&rsquo;s loss, and of their murder. Then the wretched
woman would hang round my neck, and crawl on my breast, besprinkling
me with gore that spouted from her eyeless sockets,
imploring me to save her;&mdash;till, shrieking and panting, I awoke
from the horrible nightmare. Such were the dreams that
haunted my pillow nearly all the time I was forced to remain
with these desperadoes.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I thanked God that the night of the tropics was so brief.
The first glimmer of light found me up, and as soon as I could
find a companion to control the hounds, I ran to the sea for refreshment
by a glorious surf-bath. I was on a miserable sandbar,
whose surface was hardly covered with soil; yet, in that
prolific land of rain and sunshine, nature seems only to require
the slightest footing to assert her magnificent power of vegetation.
In spots, along the arid island, were the most beautiful
groves of abundant undergrowth, matted with broad-leaved vines,
while, within their shadow, the fresh herbage sprang up, sparkling
with morning dew. In those climates, the blaze of noon is a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
season of oppressive languor, but morning and evening, with their
dawn and twilight,&mdash;their lengthened shadows and declining sun,
are draughts of beauty that have often intoxicated less enthusiastic
tempers than mine. The bath, the breeze, the renewed nature,
aroused and restored a degree of tone to my shattered nerves,
so that when I reached the <i>rancho</i>, I was ready for any duty that
might be imposed. The twin gangs had gone off in their boats
soon after daylight, with saws and axes; but Rafael left orders
with my brutal sentry that I should assist him in preparing
breakfast, which was to be ready by eleven o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>I never knew the real patronymic of this fellow, who was a
Spaniard, and passed among us by the nickname of Gallego.
Gallego possessed a good figure,&mdash;symmetrical and strong, while
it was lithe and active. But his head and face were the most
repulsive I ever encountered. The fellow was not absolutely
ugly, so far as mere contour of features was concerned; but
there was so dropsical a bloat in his cheeks, such a stagnant
sallowness in his complexion, such a watching scowl in his eyes,
such a drawling sullenness of speech, such sensuality in the turn
of his resolute lips, that I trembled to know he was to be my
daily companion. His dress and skin denoted slovenly habits,
while a rude and growling voice gave token of the bitter heart
that kept the enginery of the brute in motion.</p>

<p>With this wretch for <i>chef de cuisine</i> I was exalted to the
post of &ldquo;cook&rsquo;s mate.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I found that a fire had been already kindled beneath some
dwarf trees, and that a kettle was set over it to boil. Gallego
beckoned me to follow him into a thicket some distance from the
<i>rancho</i>, where, beneath the protection of a large tarpaulin, we
found <i>filibustero&rsquo;s</i> pantry amply provided with butter, onions,
spices, salt-fish, bacon, lard, rice, coffee, wines, and all the requisites
of comfortable living. In the corners, strewn at random on
the ground, I observed spy-glasses, compasses, sea-charts, books,
and a quantity of choice cabin-furniture. We obtained a sufficiency
of water for cookery and drinking from holes dug in the
sand, and we managed to cool the beverage by suspending it in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span>
a draft of air in porous vessels, which are known throughout the
West Indies by the mischievous name of &ldquo;monkeys.&rdquo; Our
copious thickets supplied us with fuel, nor were we without a
small, rough garden, in which the gang cultivated peppers, tomatoes
and mint. The premises being reviewed, I returned with
my ill-favored guard to take a lesson in piratical cookery.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how well these wandering vagabonds know
how to toss up a savory mess, and how admirably they understand
its enjoyment. A tickled palate is one of the great objects
of their mere animal existence, and they are generally prepared
with a mate who might pass muster in a second-rate restaurant.
The <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> we served of codfish stewed in claret, snowy and
granulated rice, delicious tomatoes and fried ham, was irreproachable.
Coffee had been drunk at day-dawn; so that my comrades
contented themselves during the meal with liberal potations of
claret, while they finished the morning with brandy and cigars.</p>

<p>By two o&rsquo;clock the breakfast was over, and most of the gorged
scamps had retired for a <i>siesta</i> during the sweltering heat. A
few of the toughest took muskets and went to the beach to shoot
gulls or sharks. Gallego and myself were dispatched to our
grove-kitchen to scullionize our utensils; and, finally, being the
youngest, I was intrusted with the honorable duty of feeding the
bloodhounds.</p>

<p>As soon as my duties were over, I was preparing to follow
the siesta-example of my betters, when I met Don Rafael coming
out of the door, and, without a word, was beckoned to follow towards
the interior of the island. When we reached a solitary
spot, two or three hundred yards from the <i>rancho</i>, Rafael drew
me down beside him in the shade of a tree, and said gently with
a smile, that he supposed I was at least <i>surprised</i> by the events
of the last four days. I must confess that I saw little for any
thing else but astonishment in them, and I took the liberty to
concede that fact to the Don.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I have brought you here to explain
a part of the mystery, and especially to let you understand why
it was that I passed myself off last night as your uncle, in order
to save your life. I was obliged to do it, boy; and, <i>voto &agrave; Dios</i>!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
I would have fought the <i>junta</i>,&mdash;bloodhounds and all,&mdash;before
they should have harmed a limb of your body!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don Rafael explained that as soon as he caught a glimpse of
my face when he boarded the <i>galliot</i> on the morning of our disaster,
he recognized the lineaments of an old companion in
arms. The resemblance caused him to address me as particularly
as he had done on the night of the piracy, the consequence
of which was that his suspicions ripened into certainty.</p>

<p>If I were writing the story of Don Rafael&rsquo;s life, instead of
my own, I might give an interesting and instructive narrative,
which showed,&mdash;as he alleged,&mdash;how those potent controllers of
outlaws,&mdash;&ldquo;circumstances,&rdquo;&mdash;had changed him from a very respectable
soldier of fortune into a genuine buccaneer. He asserted
that my uncle had been his schoolmate and professional
companion in the old world. When the war of South American
independence demanded the aid of certain Dugald Dalgettys to
help its fortune, Don Rafael and my uncle had lent the revolutionists
of Mexico their swords, for which they were repaid in
the coin that &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; commonly receive for such amiable
self-sacrifice. <i>Republics</i> are proverbially ungrateful, and Mexico,
alas! was a republic.</p>

<p>After many a buffet of fortune, my poor uncle, it seems, perished
in a duel at which Don Rafael performed the professional
part of &ldquo;his friend.&rdquo; My relation died, of course, like a &ldquo;man
of honor,&rdquo; and soon after, Don Rafael, himself, fell a victim to
the &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; which, in the end, enabled him to slaughter
my shipmates and save my life.</p>

<p>I must admit that I use this flippant tone with a twinge of
sorrow, for I think I perceived certain spasms of conscience during
our interview, which proved that, among the lees of that
withered heart, there were some rich drops of manhood ready to
mantle his cheek with shame at our surroundings. Indeed, as
he disclosed his story, he exhibited several outbursts of passionate
agony which satisfied me that if Don Rafael were in Paris,
Don Rafael would have been a most respectable <i>bourgeois</i>;
while, doubtless, there were many estimable citizens at that moment
in Paris, who would have given up their shops in order to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
become Don Rafaels in Cuba! Such is life&mdash;and &ldquo;circumstances!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our chat wasted a large portion of the afternoon. It was
terminated by a counsel from my friend to be wary in my deportment,
and a direction to console myself with the idea that he did
not mean I should tarry long upon the island.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I do not lack force of eye, voice,
and personal influence over these ruffians; yet I do not know
that I can always serve or save a friend, so your fate hangs very
much on your circumspection. Men in our situation are Ishmaelites.
Our hands are not only against all, and all against us, but
we do not know the minute when we may be all against each
other. The power of habitual control may do much for a
leader among such men; but such an one must neither quail
nor <i>deceive</i>. Therefore, <i>beware</i>! Let none of your actions
mar my projects. Let them never suspect the truth of our
consanguinity. Call me &lsquo;uncle;&rsquo; and in my mouth you shall
always be &lsquo;Theodore.&rsquo; Ask no questions; be civil, cheerful,
and serviceable about the <i>rancho</i>; never establish an intimacy,
confidence, or friendship with any <i>one</i> of the band; stifle your
feelings and your tears if you ever find them rising to your lips
or eyes; talk as little as you possibly can; avoid that smooth-tongued
Frenchman; keep away from our revels, and refrain
entirely from wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I charge you to be specially watchful of Gallego, the cook.
He is our man of dirty work,&mdash;a shameless coward, though revengeful
as a cat. If it shall ever happen that you come in collision
with him, <i>strike first and well</i>; no one cares for him;
even his death will make no stir. Take this <i>cuchillo</i>,&mdash;it is
sharp and reliable; keep it near you day and night; and, <i>in
self-defence</i>, do not hesitate to make good use of it. In a few
days, I may say more to you; until then,&mdash;<i>corragio figlio, &egrave;
addio!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>We returned to the <i>rancho</i> by different paths.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>The life of men under the ban of society, on a desolate
sand key, whose only visitors are land-crabs and sea-gulls, is
a dull and dreary affair. The genuine pirate, properly equipped
for a desperate lot, who has his swift keel beneath him and is
wafted wheresoever he lists on canvas wings, encounters, it is
true, an existence of peril; yet there is something exhilarating
and romantic in his dashing career of incessant peril: he is ever
on the wing, and ever amid novelty; there is something about
his life that smacks of genuine warfare, and his existence becomes
as much more respectable as the old-fashioned highwayman on
his mettlesome steed was superior to the sneaking footpad, who
leaped from behind a thicket and bade the unarmed pedestrian
stand and deliver. But the wrecker-pirate takes his victim at a
disadvantage, for he is not a genuine freebooter of the sea. He
shuns an able foe and strikes the crippled. Like the shark and
the eagle, he delights to prey on the carcass, rather than to strike
the living quarry.</p>

<p>The companionship into which misfortune had thrown me was
precisely of this character, and I gladly confess that I was never
tempted for a moment to bind up my fate with the sorry gang.
I confided, it is true, in Rafael&rsquo;s promise to liberate me; yet I
never abandoned the hope of escape by my own tact and energy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I became heartily tired of my scullion duties as
the subordinate of Gallego. Finding one day a chest of carpenters&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
tools among the rubbish, I busied myself in making a rudder
for one of the boats, and so well did I succeed, that when
my companions returned to breakfast from their daily &ldquo;fishing,&rdquo;
my mechanical skill was lauded to such a degree that Rafael
converted the general enthusiasm to my advantage by separating
me from the cook. I was raised to the head of our &ldquo;naval
bureau&rdquo; as boatbuilder in chief. Indeed, it was admitted on
all hands that I was abler with the adze than the ladle and
spoiled fewer boards than broths.</p>

<p>A few days passed, during which I learned that our unfortunate
galliot was gradually emptied and destroyed. This
was the usual morning occupation of the whole gang until
the enterprise ended. When the job was over Don Rafael told
me that he was about to depart hurriedly on business with the
whole company, to the mainland of Cuba, so that, during his
absence, the island and its property would be left in custody of
Gallego, myself, and the bloodhounds. He specially charged the
cook to keep sober, and to give a good account of himself at the
end of <i>five days</i>, which would terminate his absence.</p>

<p>But no sooner was the <i>patron</i> away, than the lazy scamp neglected
his duties, skulked all day among the bushes, and refused
even to furnish my food or supply the dogs. Of course, I speedily
attended to the welfare of myself and the animals; but, at
night, the surly Galician came home, prepared his own supper,
drank till he was completely drunk, and retired without uttering
a word.</p>

<p>I was glad that he yielded to the temptation of liquor, as I
hoped he would thereby become incapable of harming me during
the watches of the night, if weariness compelled me to sleep.
He was a malignant wretch, and his taciturnity and ill-will appeared
so ominous now that I was left utterly alone, that I
resolved, if possible, to keep awake, and not to trust to luck or
liquor. The galliot&rsquo;s tragedy and anxiety stood me in stead, so
that I did not close my eyes in sleep the whole of that dreary
vigil. About midnight, Gallego stealthily approached my cot,
and pausing a moment to assure himself that I was in the profound
repose which I admirable feigned, he turned on tip-toe to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span>
the door of our cabin, and disappeared with a large bundle in his
hand. He did not return until near day-dawn; and, next night,
the same act was exactly repeated.</p>

<p>The mysterious sullenness of this vagabond not only alarmed,
but increased my nervousness, for I can assure the reader that,
on a desolate island, without a companion but a single outcast,
one would rather hear the sound of that wretch&rsquo;s voice than be
doomed to the silence of such inhuman solitude. During the
day he kept entirely aloof,&mdash;generally at sea fishing,&mdash;affording
me time for a long <i>siesta</i> in a nook near the shore, penetrated
by a thorny path, which Gallego could not have traced without
hounds. On the fourth night, when the pirate left our hut for
his accustomed excursion, I resolved to follow; and taking a
pistol with renewed priming, I pursued his steps at a safe distance,
till I saw him enter a thick shrubbery, in which he was
lost. I marked the spot and returned to the cabin. Next
morning, after coffee, Gallego departed in his canoe to fish. I
watched him anxiously from the beach until he anchored about
two miles from the reef, and then calling the dogs, retraced my
way to the thicket. The hounds were of great service, for,
having placed them on the track, they instantly traced the path
of the surly scoundrel.</p>

<p>After some trouble in passing the dense copse of underwood,
I entered a large patch of naked sand, broken by heaps of stones,
which appeared to cover graves. One heap bore the form of a
cross, and was probably the sepulchre of a wrecker. I stopped
awhile and reflected as to further explorations. On entering this
arid graveyard, I observed a number of land-crabs scamper away;
but, after awhile, when I sat down in a corner and became perfectly
quiet, I noticed that the army returned to the field and
introduced themselves into all the heaps of stones or graves <i>save
one</i>. This struck me as singular; for, when people are so hopelessly
alone as I was, they become minute observers, and derive
infinite happiness from the consideration of the merest trifles.
Accordingly, I ventured close to the abandoned heap, and found
at once that the neighboring sand had been freshly smoothed.
I was on Gallego&rsquo;s track! In dread of detection, I stealthily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
climbed a tree, and, screening myself behind the foliage, peered
out towards the sea till I beheld the cook at work beyond the
reef. My musket and pistols were again examined and found in
order. With these precautions, I began to remove the stones,
taking care to mark their relative positions so that I might replace
them exactly; and, in about ten minutes work at excavation,
I came upon two barrels, one of which was filled with bundles
of silk, linens, and handkerchiefs, while the other contained
a chronometer, several pieces of valuable lace, and a beautifully
bound, gilt, and ornamented <i>Bible</i>. One bundle, tied in a Madras
handkerchief, particularly attracted my attention, for I thought
I recognized the covering. Within it I found a number of trinkets
belonging to the wife of my Dutch captain, and a large hairpin,
set with diamonds, which I remember she wore the last day
of her life. Had this wretch torn it from her head, as he imbrued
his hands in her blood on that terrible night? The painful
revelation brought all before me once more with appalling
force. I shuddered and became sick. Yet, I had no time for
maudlin dalliance with my feelings. Replacing every thing with
precision, and smoothing the sand once more with my flannel
shirt, I returned to the <i>rancho</i>, where I indulged in the boyish
but honest outburst of nature which I could no longer restrain.
I was not then&mdash;and, thank God, I am not now&mdash;a stranger to
tears! To the world, the human heart and the human eye, like
the coral isle of the Atlantic, may be parched and withered;
yet beneath the seared and arid surface, the living water still
flows and gushes, when the rock and the heart alike are stricken!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Just before sunset of this day, the deep baying of our hounds
gave notice of approaching strangers; and, soon after, four boats
appeared in the cove. The two foremost belonged to Don Rafael
and his crew, while the others were filled with strangers whose
appearance was that of landsmen rather than mariners. As
Rafael received them on the beach, he introduced them to me as
his especial pets, the &ldquo;<span class="smcap lowercase">AMPHIBIOUS JEWS</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our delicious supper of that night was augmented by a fine
store of beef, pork and fowls, brought from shore. I lingered at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
table as long as the company maintained a decent sobriety, and
learned that these salt water Hebrews were, in truth, speculators
from Cardenas, who accompanied Rafael in the guise of fishermen,
to purchase the plundered cargo of my galliot.</p>

<p>During his visit to Cuba, Don Rafael was apprised that the
Cuban authorities were about sending an Inspector among the
islands off the coast, and accordingly took precaution to furnish
himself in advance with a regular &ldquo;fishing license.&rdquo; All hands
were forthwith set to work to make our key and <i>rancho</i> conform
to this calling, and, in a few days, the canvas roof of our hut
was replaced by a thatch of leaves, while every dangerous article
or implement was concealed in the thicket of a labyrinthine creek.
In fact, our piscatory character could not be doubted. In our
persons and occupation, we looked as innocent and rustic as a
pic-nic party on a summer bivouac for fresh air and salt bathing.
Nor was the transformation less real in regard to our daily tasks.
We became, in reality, most industrious fishermen; so that we
had more than a thousand of the finny tribe piled up and dried,
when the hounds signalled the arrival of the expected officials.</p>

<p>Breakfast was on the table when they landed, but it was the
<i>banyan</i> meal of humble men, whose nets were never filled with
aught but the <i>scaly</i> products of the sea. Our inspector was
regaled with a scant fish-feast, and allowed to digest it over the
genuine license. Rafael complained sadly of hard times and
poverty;&mdash;in fact, the drama of humility was played to perfection,
and, finally, the functionary signed our license, with a certificate
of our loyalty, and pocketed a moderate &ldquo;gratification&rdquo;
of <i>five ounces</i>!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Six long, hot, and wretched weeks passed over my head before
any striking occurrence relieved the monotony of my life.
During the whole of this period, our fishing adventure was
steadily pursued, when information was mysteriously brought to
the key that a richly-laden French vessel had run ashore on
the Cayo Verde, an islet some forty miles east of the Cruz del
Padre. That afternoon, both of our large boats were filled
with armed men, and, as they departed with <i>every</i> wrecker
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
aboard, I alone was left on the islet to guard our property with
the dogs.</p>

<p>The thought and hope of escape both swelled in my breast
as I saw the hulls dwindle to a dot and disappear behind the
horizon. In a moment, my plan was conceived and perfected.
The sea was perfectly smooth, and I was expert in the use of oars.
That very night I launched our canoe,&mdash;the only vessel left in
the cove,&mdash;and placing the sail, scullers, and grappling-hook
within it, returned to the <i>rancho</i> for clothing. As it was dark,
I lighted a candle, when, on looking into the clothes-chest
beneath my bed, I found inscribed on the lid, in fresh chalk-marks,
the words &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Patience! wait!</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This discovery made me pause in my preparations. Was it
the warning&mdash;as it was certainly the handwriting&mdash;of Rafael?
Had he purposely and honorably left me alone, in order to escape
this scene of blood? Did he anticipate my effort to fly, and endeavor
to save me from the double risk of crossing to the mainland,
and of future provision for my comfort? I could not doubt
its being the work of my friend; and, whether it was superstition
or prudence, I cannot say, but I resolved, unhesitatingly, to
abandon a scheme in regard to which I hesitated. Instead,
therefore, of attempting to pass the strait between the key and
Cuba, I went to bed, and slept more comfortably in my utter
abandonment than I had done since I was on the island.</p>

<p>Next day, at noon, I descried a small pilot-boat sailing inside
the reef, with all the confidence of a perfect master of the channel.
Two persons speedily landed, with provisions from the
mainland, and stated that, on his last visit to Cuba, Don Rafael
engaged them to take me to Havana. This, however, was to be
done with much caution, inasmuch as his men would not assent
to my departure until they had compromised my life with theirs
by some act of desperate guilt. The pilots declined taking me
then without my guardian&rsquo;s assent;&mdash;and, in truth, so fully was
I convinced of his intention to liberate me in the best and speediest
way, that I made up my mind to abide where I was till he
returned.</p>

<p>For three days more I was doomed to solitude. On the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
fourth, the boats came back, with the pilot&rsquo;s cutter, and I quickly
saw that a serious encounter had taken place. The pilot-boat
appeared to be deeply laden. Next day, she was taken to the
mazes of the winding and wooded creek, where, I learned, the
booty was disembarked and hidden. While the party had gone
to complete this portion of their enterprise, the Frenchman, who
was wounded in the head and remained behind, took that opportunity
to enlighten me on passing events. When the wreckers
reached Cayo Verde, they found the French vessel already taken
possession of by &ldquo;fishermen&rdquo; of that quarter. Anticipated in
their dirty work, our comrades were in no mood to be sociable
with the fortunate party. An affray was the natural result, in
which knives had been freely used, while Mesclet himself had
been rescued by Rafael, pistol in hand, after receiving the violent
blow on his head from which he was now suffering. Having secured
a retreat to their boats, they were just beginning to think
of a rapid departure, when the friendly pilot-boat hove in sight.
So fortunate a reinforcement renerved our gang. A plan of
united action was quickly concerted. The French vessel was
again hoarded and carried. Two of the opposite party were
slain in the onslaught; and, finally, a rich remnant of the cargo
was seized, though the greater part of the valuables had, no
doubt, been previously dispatched ashore by the earlier band of
desperadoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; added the narrator, &ldquo;we have now the boat
and the assistance of Bachicha, who is as brave as Rafael: with
his &lsquo;<i>Baltimore clipper</i>,&rsquo; we shall conduct our affairs on a grander
scale than heretofore. <i>Sacre-bleu!</i> we may now cruise under the
Columbian flag, and rob Peter to pay Paul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, the &ldquo;clipper&rdquo; had brought down an ample store of
ammunition, under the innocent name of &ldquo;provisions,&rdquo; while she
carried in her bowels a long six, which she was ready to mount
amidships at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>

<p>But poor Mesclet did not live to enjoy the fruits of the larger
piracy, which he hoped to carry on in a more elegant way with
Bachicha. The <i>rou&eacute;</i> could not be restrained from the favorite
beverages of his beautiful France. His wound soon mastered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
him; and, in a month, all that was mortal of this gallant Gaul,
who, in earlier years, had figured in the best saloons of his country,
rested among sand-graves of a Cuban key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; growled Gallego, as they came home from his burial,
&ldquo;there is one less to share our earnings; and, what is better,
claret and brandy will be more plentiful now that this sponge is
under the sand!&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>In a few days, the boats were laden with fish for the mainland,
in order to cover the real object of our <i>patron&rsquo;s</i> visit to
Cuba, which was to dispose of the booty. At his departure, he
repeated the cherished promise of liberty, and privately hinted
that I had better continue fishing on good terms with Se&ntilde;or Gallego.</p>

<p>It required some time to repair the nets, for they had been
rather neglected during our late fishing, so that it was not, in
fact, until Rafael had been three days gone that I took the canoe
with Gallego, and dropped anchor outside the reef, to take breakfast
before beginning our labor.</p>

<p>We had hardly begun a frugal meal when, suddenly, a large
schooner shot from behind a bend of the island, and steered
in our direction. As the surly Spaniard never spoke, I had
become accustomed to be equally silent. Unexpectedly, however,
he gave a scowling glance from beneath his shaggy brows
at the vessel, and exclaimed with unusual energy: &ldquo;A Columbian
privateer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had best up anchor, and get inside the reef,&rdquo; continued
he, &ldquo;or our sport will be spoiled for the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; returned I, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s not making for us, and, even
if she were, I wouldn&rsquo;t be such a coward as to run!&rdquo; Indeed,
I had heard so much of &ldquo;Columbian privateers&rdquo; and the patriot
service, that I rather longed to be captured, that I might try my
hand at lawful war and glory. The impulse was sudden and
silly.</p>

<p>Still Gallego insisted on retreating; until, at length, we got
into an angry controversy, which the cook, who was in the bow
of the boat, attempted to end by cutting the anchor-rope. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span>
he was drawing his knife to execute this purpose, I swiftly lifted
an oar, and, with a single blow, laid him senseless in the bottom
of the canoe. By this time the schooner was within pistol-shot;
and, as she passed with a three-knot breeze, the captain, who had
witnessed the scene, threw a grappling-iron into our skiff, and
taking us in tow, dragged the boat from its moorings.</p>

<p>As soon as we got into deeper water, I was ordered on deck,
while Gallego, still quite insensible, was hoisted carefully on
board. I told the truth as to our dispute, reserving, however,
the important fact that I had been originally urged into the quarrel
by my anxiety &ldquo;to ship&rdquo; on board a privateer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want a pilot for Key West,&rdquo; said the master, hurriedly,
&ldquo;and I have no time to trifle with your stupid quarrels. Can
either of you perform this service?&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time Gallego had been somewhat roused from his
stupor, and pointing feebly towards me, uttered a languid:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
and an <i>excellent</i> one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mistaking the word &ldquo;<i>pilote</i>,&rdquo; which in Spanish signifies
&ldquo;navigator,&rdquo; the French captain, who spoke the Castilian very
badly, translated it into the more limited meaning attached to
that peculiar profession, one of whose ministers he was anxious
to secure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bon!</i>&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;put the other fellow back into
his skiff, and make sail at once under charge of this youngster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remonstrated, protested, declaimed, swore, that I knew nothing
of Key West and its approaches; but all my efforts were
vain. I was a pilot in spite of myself.</p>

<p>The malicious cook enjoyed the joke of which I had so hastily
become the victim. As they lowered him again into the
boat, he jeered at my incredulity, and in ten minutes was towed
to the edge of the reef, where the scamp was turned adrift to
make for the island.</p>

<p>When the schooner was once more under full sail, I was ordered
to give the course for Key West. I at once informed the
captain, whose name I understood to be Lamin&eacute;, that he really
labored under a mistake in translating the Spanish word <i>pilote</i>
into <i>port guide</i>, and assured him that Gallego had been prompted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
by a double desire to get rid of him as well as me by fostering
his pernicious error. I acknowledged that I was a &ldquo;<i>pilot</i>,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;navigator,&rdquo; though not a &ldquo;<i>practico</i>,&rdquo; or harbor-pilot; yet I
urged that I could not, without absolute foolhardiness, undertake
to conduct his schooner into a port of which I was utterly ignorant,
and had never visited. Hereupon the first lieutenant or
mate interposed. This fellow was a short, stout-built person of
thirty-five, with reddish whiskers and hair, a long-projecting under-jaw,
and eye-teeth that jutted out like tusks. To add to his
ugliness, he was sadly pitted by small-pox, and waddled about on
short duck legs, which were altogether out of proportion to his
long body, immense arms, and broad, massive shoulders. I do
not remember a more vulgarly repulsive person than this privateering
lieutenant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a liar, Captain Lamin&eacute;, and only wants to extort
money for his services,&rdquo; interjected the brute. &ldquo;Leave him to
me, sir; I&rsquo;ll find a way to refresh his memory of Key West that
will open the bottom of the gulf to his eyes as clearly as the
pathway to his piratical hut on the sand key! To the helm,
sir&mdash;to the helm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>What possible object or result could I gain by resistance
amid the motley assemblage that surrounded me on the deck of
the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cara-bobo</span>?&rdquo; She was a craft of about 200 tons; and,
with her crew of seventy-five, composed of the scourings of all
nations, castes, and colors, bore a commission from the authorities
of Carthagena to burn, sink and destroy all Spanish property
she was strong enough to capture. Lamin&eacute; was born in
the isle of France, while Lasquetti, the lieutenant, was a
creole of Pensacola. The latter spoke French and Spanish quite
well, but very little English; while both master and mate were
almost entirely ignorant of navigation, having intrusted that task
to the third lieutenant, who was then ill with yellow fever. The
second lieutenant was absent on board a prize.</p>

<p>Thus forced to take charge of a privateer without a moment&rsquo;s
warning, I submitted with the best grace, and, calling for charts
and instruments, I shaped my way for the destined port. All
day we steered west-north-west, but at sunset, as we had run
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
along smartly, I ordered the schooner to be &ldquo;laid to&rdquo; for the
night. The wind and weather were both charmingly fair, and
objections were of course made to my command. But, as the
most difficult part of our navigation was to be encountered during
the night, if I kept on my course, I resolved to persist to the
last in my resolution, and I was fortunate enough to carry my
point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n you,&rdquo; said Lasquetti, as the vessel was brought to the
wind and made snug for the night, &ldquo;d&mdash;n you, Master T&eacute;odore;
this laying-to shall give <i>you</i> no rest, at least, if you thought to
dodge work, and get into a hammock by means of it! You shall
march the deck all night to see that we don&rsquo;t drift on a reef, if
I have to sit up, or stand up till day-dawn to watch you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obedience, alas! had been the order of the day with me for
a long while; so I promenaded the lee quarter till nearly midnight,
when, utterly exhausted by fatigue, I sat down on a long
brass chaser, and almost instantly fell asleep.</p>

<p>I know not how long I rested, but a tremendous shock
knocked me from the cannon and laid me flat on the deck, bleeding
from mouth, nose and ears. Lasquetti stood beside me,
cigar in hand, laughing immoderately, blaspheming like a demon,
and kicking me in the ribs with his rough wet-weather boots.
He had detected me asleep, and touched off the gun with his
<i>havanna</i>!</p>

<p>The explosion aroused all hands, and brought the commander
on deck. My blood flowed, but it did not pour fast enough to
relieve my agonizing rage. As soon as I recovered consciousness,
I seized the first heavy implement I could grasp, and rushed
at my aggressor, whose skull was saved from the blow by descending
beneath the combings of the hatchway, which, the instant
after, were shivered by the descent of my heavy weapon.
Lamin&eacute; was a man of some sensibility, and, though selfish, as
usual with his set, could not avoid at once reprimanding Lasquetti
with uncommon severity in presence of his men.</p>

<p>That afternoon, I was fortunate enough, by the aid of a good
chart, and a sort of <i>navigating instinct</i>, to anchor the &ldquo;Cara-bobo&rdquo;
in the narrow harbor of Key West. When Lamin&eacute; went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
ashore, he ordered me not to leave the schooner, while sentries
were placed to prevent boats from boarding or even approaching
us. Hardly was the master out of the vessel before two men
seized me as I looked at the shore through a telescope. In the
twinkling of an eye, I was hurried below and double-ironed; nor
would I have received a morsel of food save bread and water
during our detention, had I not been secretly fed by some good
fellows from the forecastle, who stole to me after dark with the
remnant of their rations. This was the cowardly revenge of
Lasquetti.</p>

<p>On the third day, Lamin&eacute; returned, bringing an American
pilot for the coast and islands. I was set at liberty as he was
seen approaching; and when we got under way on another
cruise, I was commanded to do duty as sailing-master, which I
promptly refused with spirited indignation, until I received satisfaction
from the dastard lieutenant. But this fellow had taken
care to forestall me, by assuring Lamin&eacute; that he never dreamed
of securing me until I was caught in the very act of escaping
from the schooner!</p>

<p>During a week&rsquo;s cruise of indifferent success with these
&ldquo;patriots,&rdquo; I won the kind heart of the American pilot, who
heard the story of my late adventures with patience; and, through
his influence with the commander, my lot was mitigated, notwithstanding
my refusal to do duty. By this time, the third lieutenant
was restored to sufficient health to resume the deck. He
was a native of Spain and a gallant sailor. Many an hour did
he pass beside me, recounting his adventures or listening to
mine, until I seemed to win his sympathy, and insure his assistance
for relief from this miserable tyranny.</p>

<p>At length, the schooner&rsquo;s course was shaped for the Cruz del
Padre, while I was summoned to the cabin. I perceived at once
a singular change for the better in Monsieur Lamin&eacute;&rsquo;s manner.
He requested me to be seated; pressed me to accept a tumbler
of claret; inquired about my health, and ended this harmonious
overture by saying, that if I would sign a document exonerating
him from all charges of compulsory detention or ill-treatment, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
would pay me two hundred dollars for my service, and land me
again on the key.</p>

<p>I promptly saw that his object in replacing me on the island
was to prevent my complaints against his conduct from reaching
the ears of a tribunal in a neutral port; and, accordingly, I
declined the proposition,&mdash;demanding, however, to be put on
board of any vessel we met, no matter what might be her nationality.
I sternly refused his money, and insisted that my only
desire was to be free from his brutal officer.</p>

<p>But Lamin&eacute; was in power and I was not. In the end, I
discovered that worse consequences might befall me among these
ruffians, if I hesitated to take the recompense and sign the
paper. In fact, I began to be quite satisfied that, in reality, it
was an <i>escape</i> to be freed from the privateer, even if I took
refuge once more among pirates!</p>

<p>So, after a good deal of claret and controversy had been
wasted, I signed the document and pocketed the cash.</p>

<p>As the first bars of saffron streaked the east next morning,
the reef of the Cruz del Padre hove in sight dead ahead. The
third lieutenant presented me at my departure with a set of
charts, a spy-glass, a quadrant, and a large bag of clothes; while,
in the breast of a rich silk waistcoat, he concealed three ounces
and a silver watch, which he desired me to wear in honor of him,
if ever I was fortunate enough to tread the streets of Havana.
Several of the white sailors also offered me useful garments; and
a black fellow, who had charge of the boat in which I was sent
ashore, forced on me two sovereigns, which he considered a small
gratuity to &ldquo;<i>a countryman</i>&rdquo; in distress. He hailed from Marblehead,
and protested that he knew me in Salem when I was a
lad.</p>

<p>As the boat approached the <i>rancho&rsquo;s</i> cove, I perceived every
body under arms, and heard Don Rafael command my boatmen,
in a loud, imperious voice, to begone, or he would fire. Standing
on the thwarts of the boat, I ordered the oarsmen to back water,
and leaping into the sea, waist-deep, struggled alone to the beach,
calling &ldquo;mi tio! mi tio!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>my uncle! Don Rafael!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;who,
recognizing my voice and gestures, promptly rushed forward to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
embrace me. Our boat was then allowed to approach the landing
and disburthen itself of the gifts. I thought it best to
request my sable ally from Marblehead to narrate, in as good
Spanish or <i>lingua-franca</i>, as he could press into his service, the
whole story of my capture and the conduct of Gallego. This
being done, the boat and its crew were dispatched aboard with a
multitude of Spanish courtesies and the substantial gift of some
<i>Chateau Margaux</i>.</p>

<p>After an early supper, I became the lion of the evening, and
was requested to give a narrative of my cruise in the &ldquo;patriot
service.&rdquo; I noticed that some of the gang looked on me askance
with an incredulous air, while others amused themselves by
smoking and spitting in a very contemptuous way whenever I
reached what I conceived to be a thrilling portion of my story.
At its conclusion, I arose and deposited in the hands of Don
Rafael my gifts of two hundred dollars and the two sovereigns.
This evidence of reciprocity seemed to restore the good temper
of my impatient hearers, so that, by the time the <i>patron</i> went
round the circle, giving each man his share of my earnings,&mdash;not
even omitting Gallego,&mdash;my credit was almost restored among
the gang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for these two pieces of gold, these charts, instruments
and clothes,&rdquo; said Don Rafael, &ldquo;they are the property of the
youth, and I am sure none of you are mean enough to divide
them. The money was another thing. That was <i>his</i> earning, as
the &lsquo;fishing <i>revenue</i>&rsquo; is ours; and as he is entitled to a share
of what <i>we</i> gain, we are entitled to participate in whatever <i>he</i>
wins. Yet, <i>amigos</i>, this is not all. My nephew, <i>caballeros</i>, has
been accused, by one of this party, <i>during his absence</i>, of being
not only a contemptible thief, but a traitor and coward. Now,
as these are three &lsquo;blasphemous vituperations&rsquo; which are not to
be found under any head in my prayer-book, and never were
chargeable on the blood of our family, I insist on immediate justice
to my kinsman. Let that cowardly scoundrel repeat and
<i>prove</i> his accusation of T&eacute;odore, face to face! You, <i>se&ntilde;ores</i>,
shall stand judges. Every thing shall be fair. To-night, my
boy shall be found guilty or purged of the baseness imputed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
him; and, moreover, I apprise you now, that if he is innocent, I
shall to-morrow restore him to liberty. His voluntary return
was a voucher of honesty; and I doubt whether there is a clever
man among you who does not agree with me. Stand forth, Gallego,
and charge this youth again with the infamy you heaped on
him while he was away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the sullen wretch bowed his head, with a hang-dog look,
and rolled his black and bushy skull slowly from side to side,
with an air of bullying defiance. Still he remained perfectly
silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand forth, Gallego, once more, I say!&rdquo; shouted Don
Rafael, stamping with fury and foaming at the mouth; &ldquo;stand
forth, imp of the devil, and make good your charge, or I&rsquo;ll trice
you up to these rafters by your thumbs, and lash you with a cow-hide
till your stretched skin peels off in ribbons!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The threat restored Gallego&rsquo;s voice; but he could only say
that there was no use in repeating the charges, because the case
was prejudged, and all feared Don Rafael and his parasite to
such a degree that it was impossible to treat him with justice.
&ldquo;Yet, look ye, se&ntilde;ores, if I can&rsquo;t talk, I can fight. If Don Rafael
is ready to meet me, knife in hand, in support of my cause, why,
all I have to say is, that I am ready for him and his bastard
to boot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment, Rafael&rsquo;s knife was out of his belt, and the two
sprang forward in a death-struggle, which would doubtless have
been a short affair, had not the whole party interposed between
the combatants and forbidden the fight. In the hurly-burly,
Gallego took to his heels and departed.</p>

<p>The scoundrel&rsquo;s escape caused some alarm in the camp, as it
was feared he might leave the island, and, turning king&rsquo;s evidence,
make the waters of Cuba too hot for the band. Accordingly,
all the canoes and boats that night were drawn up on the
beach and kept under double watch.</p>

<p>When order was restored in the <i>rancho</i>, I asked Don Rafael
to explain the &ldquo;three accusations&rdquo; that had been made against
my fair fame; when I learned that I was charged by Gallego
with having felled him in the boat, with having shipped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
voluntarily in the privateer, and with returning in the Cara-bobo&rsquo;s
boats <i>to rob the rancho of its valuables</i>!</p>

<p>The first of the allegations I admitted to be true; the second
had been disproved by the privateer&rsquo;s boatmen; and, as to the
third, I at once insisted upon the party&rsquo;s taking torches and
accompanying me to the graveyard, where, I told them, they
would find&mdash;as, in truth, they did&mdash;the valuables this villain had
charged me with stealing. On our way thither, I recounted the
manner in which I detected his infamy.</p>

<p>Nest morning we divided into two parties, and taking the
dogs, proceeded in chase of the dastard Galician. He was
quickly tracked by the hounds and caught asleep, with two empty
flasks beside him.</p>

<p>A drum-head court-martial at once convened for his trial, and
it was unanimously resolved to chain him to a tree, where he was
to be left exposed to the elements until he starved to death.
The passive and silent fit had again come over Gallego. I implored
that the sentence might be softened, but I was laughed at
for my childish pity, and ordered home to the <i>rancho</i>. The command
to chain him having been executed, the Spanish outcast
was left to his terrible fate. One of the men, out of compassion,
as he said, secretly conveyed a case of gin to the doomed man,
and left it within reach, either to solace his departure from the
world, or to render him insensible. But his end was speedy.
Next morning the guard found him dead, with six empty bottles
out of the case. His body was denied the rites of sepulture.
It was left lying in chains as he perished, to rot in the sun and
be devoured by the insects generated from his decay.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>When these dreadful scenes were over, Don Rafael took me
aside with the pleasant news that the time for my liberation was
indeed arrived. He handed me one hundred and twenty-five
dollars, which wore my share of the proceeds of our lawful
fishing. &ldquo;Take the money,&rdquo; said Rafael, with a good deal of
feeling; &ldquo;take it, young man, with <i>perfect</i> confidence;&mdash;<i>there is
no blood on it!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>My preparations for departure were quickly made, as Bachicha
was in the cove with his craft ready to take me to the mainland.
I bade a hasty adieu to the gang; and perhaps it is rare
that any one ever abandoned the companions of several months&rsquo;
intimacy with so little pain. Rafael&rsquo;s solicitude for my character
touched me. He had done all in his power to preserve my self-respect,
and I was, therefore, well disposed to regard the good
counsel he gave me at parting, and to believe in his sincerity
when he pictured a bright future, and contrasted it with his own
desolation and remorse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have recommended you, <i>hijo mio</i>, to a friend in Regla,
on the opposite side of the harbor at Havana, who will take
care of you. He is a <i>paisano</i> of ours. Take these additional
ten ounces, which are the fruit of honest labor. They will help
you to appear properly in Havana; so that, with the care of
Bachicha and our Regla countryman, I don&rsquo;t despair of your
welfare. <span class="smcap">Adios!</span> <i>para siempre!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
And so we parted;&mdash;and it was, indeed, an adieu for ever.
We never met again, but I heard of Don Rafael and his fortunes.
The new enterprise with the pilot-boat turned out successfully,
and the band acquired considerable property on the island before
the piratical nests along the coast of Cuba were broken up by
cruisers. Rafael had some narrow escapes from the noose and
the yard arm; but he eluded the grasp of his pursuers, and died
a respectable <i>ranchero</i> on a comfortable farm in the interior of
the Queen of the Antilles.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>The light winds of summer soon brought us inside the Moro
Castle, past the frowning batteries of the Cabanas, and at
anchor near Regla, within the beautiful harbor of Havana. I
shall never forget the impression made on my mind by this delicious
scene as it first broke on my sight at sunrise, in all the cool
freshness of morning. The grand amphitheatre of hills swept
down to the calm and lake-like water with gentle slopes, lapped
in the velvet robes of richest green, and embroidered, as it were,
with lace-like spots of castle, fort, dwelling, and villa, until the
seaward points were terminated on the left, by the brilliant city,
and on the right by a pile of majestic batteries.</p>

<p>This grand and lasting impression was made almost at a
glance, for, at my time of life, I was more concerned with man
than nature, and rarely paused to dwell on the most fascinating
scenery. Accordingly, I hastened to Regla with my letter of
introduction, which was <i>interpreted</i> by Bachicha to the Italian
grocer, the friend of Rafael, to whom I was confided. <i>Il signore
Carlo Cibo</i> was an illiterate man of kind heart, who had adventurously
emigrated from Italy to furnish the Havanese with good
things; while, in return, the Havanese had been so pleased with
his provender, that Carlo may be said to have been a man &ldquo;very
well to do in the world&rdquo; for a foreigner. He received me with
unbounded kindness;&mdash;welcomed me to his bachelor home;&mdash;apologized
for its cold cheerlessness, and ordered me to consider
himself and his &ldquo;<i>casa</i>&rdquo; entirely at my disposal as long as I
chose to remain.</p>

<p>I was content to accept this unstinted hospitality for a few
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
days, while I ran over the town, the hills, and the <i>paseos</i>; but I
could not consent to dally long eating the bread of idleness and
charity. I observed that my friend Carlo was either the most
prudent or least inquisitive man I knew, for he never asked me a
question about my early or recent history. As he would not
lend the conversation to my affairs, I one day took the liberty to
inquire whether there was a vessel in port bound to the Pacific
Ocean or Mexico, in which my protector could possibly find a
situation for me as an officer, or procure me permission to work
my way even as a common sailor.</p>

<p>The kind grocer instantly divined my true motive, and while
he honored me for it, deprecated the idea of my departure. He
said that my visit, instead of being a burden, was a pleasure he
could not soon replace. As to the expenses of his house, he
declared they were, in fact, <i>not</i> increased. What fed five, fed
half a dozen; and, as to my proposal to go to Mexico, or any
other place in Spanish America on the Continent, with a view of
&ldquo;making my fortune,&rdquo; he warmly protested against it, in consequence
of his own experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They can never conquer their jealousy of <i>foreigners</i>,&rdquo; said
Carlo; &ldquo;you may live with them for years, and imagine yourself
as intimate as brothers; but, at last, <i>carramba</i>, you will
find something turn up, that marks you an alien and kindles
nationality against you. Take my advice, Don T&eacute;odore, stay
where you are; study Spanish carefully; get the hang of the
people; and, my life on it, before long, you&rsquo;ll have your hands
full of trump cards and the game in your power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did as he desired, and was presented to a corpulent
old quiz of a <i>padre</i>, who pretended to instruct me in classical
Castilian. Two lessons demonstrated his incapacity; but as he
was a jolly gossip of my grocer, and hail-fellow with the whole
village of Regla, I thought it good policy to continue his pupil
in appearance, while I taught myself <i>in private</i>. Besides this,
the <i>padre</i> was a <i>bon vivant</i> and devoted lover of fish. Now, as
I happened to be a good sportsman, with a canoe at my command,
I managed to supply his kitchen with an abundance of
the finny tribe, which his cook was an adept in preparing. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
may be supposed that our &ldquo;fast days&rdquo; were especial epochs of
delicious reunion. A fine dinner smoked on the table; a good
bottle was added by the grocer; and, while my entertainer discussed
the viands, I contrived to keep him in continual chat,
which, in reality, was the best practical lesson a man in my
circumstances could receive.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>It is strange how our lives and destinies are often decided by
trifles. As I sailed about the harbor in idleness, my nautical
eye and taste were struck by the trim rig of the sharp built
&ldquo;slavers,&rdquo; which, at that time, used to congregate at Havana.
There was something bewitching to my mind in their race-horse
beauty. A splendid vessel has always had the same influence on
my mind, that I have heard a splendid woman has on the minds
of other men. These dashing <i>slavers</i>, with their arrowy hulls
and raking masts, got complete possession of my fancy. There
was hardly a day that I did not come home with a discovery of
added charms. Signor Carlo listened in silence and nodded his
head, when I was done, with an approving smile and a
&ldquo;<i>bueno!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I continued my sailing peregrinations for a month around the
harbor, when my kind entertainer invited me to accompany him
aboard a vessel of which, he said, he owned two shares&mdash;<i>she
was bound to Africa!</i> The splendid clipper was one of the very
craft that had won my heart; and my feverish soul was completely
upset by the gala-scene as we drifted down the bay, partaking
of a famous breakfast, and quaffing bumpers of Champagne
to the schooner&rsquo;s luck. When she passed the Moro Castle
we leaped into our boats, and gave the voyagers three hearty
and tipsy cheers. My grocer was a &ldquo;slaver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had a thousand questions for the Italian in regard to the
trade, now that I found <i>he</i> belonged to the fraternity. All my
inquiries were gratified in his usually amiable manner; and that
night, in my dreams, I was on board of a coaster chased by
John Bull.</p>

<p>My mind was made up. Mexico, Peru, South American independence,
patriotism, and all that, were given to the breezes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
of the gulf. I slept off my headache and nightmare; and next
morning announced to Cibo my abandonment of the Costa
Firma, and my anxiety to get a situation in a vessel bound to
Africa.</p>

<p>In a few days I was told that my wishes would perhaps be
gratified, as a fast vessel from the Canaries was about to be
sold; and if she went off a bargain, Signor Carlo had resolved
to purchase her, with a friend, to send to Africa.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Canary &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Globo</span>&rdquo; was acquired for $3000;
and after a perfect refitting at the Casa-Blanca of Havana,
loomed in the harbor as a respectable pilot-boat of forty tons.
Her name, in consequence of reputed speed, was changed to &ldquo;El
Areostatico;&rdquo; a culverine was placed amidships; all the requisites
for a slave cargo were put on board; fifteen sailors, the refuse
of the press-gang and jail-birds, were shipped; powder, ammunition,
and small arms, were abundantly supplied; and, last
of all, four kegs, ballasted with specie, were conveyed into the
cabin to purchase our return cargo.</p>

<p>It was on the 2d of September, 1826, after a charming <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>,
that I bade farewell to my friend Carlo on the deck of
the Areostatico, cleared for the Cape de Verd isles, but, in
truth, bound for the Rio Pongo. Our crew consisted of twenty-one
scamps&mdash;Spaniards, Portuguese, Frenchmen, and mongrels.
The Majorcan captain was an odd character to intrust with such
an enterprise, and probably nowhere else, save in Havana at
that period, would he have been allowed to command a slaver.
He was a scientific navigator, but no sailor;&mdash;afraid of his
shadow, he had not a particle of confidence in his own judgment;
every body was listened to, and he readily yielded his opinions
without argument or controversy. Our chief officer, a Catalonian
cousin of the captain, made no pretensions to seamanship, yet he
was a good mathematician. I still remember the laughs I had
at the care he took of his lily-white hands, and the jokes we
cracked upon his girl-like manners, voice, and conversation. The
boatswain, who was in his watch, assured me that he rarely gave
an order without humming it out to a tune of some favorite
opera.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
In this fantastic group, I occupied the position of supernumerary
officer and interpreter; but accustomed, as I had been,
to wholesome <i>American</i> seamanship and discipline, I trembled
not a little when I discovered the amazing ignorance of the master,
and observed the utter worthlessness of our crew. These
things made me doubly vigilant; and sometimes I grieved that
I was not still in Regla, or on the <i>paseo</i>. On the tenth day out,
a northwester began to pipe and ripen to a gale as the sea rose
with it. Sail had been soon diminished on the schooner; but
when I was relieved in my watch by the first officer, I hinted to
the captain that it would be best to lay the vessel to as soon as
possible. We had been scudding before the tempest for some
hours under a close-reefed foresail, and I feared if we did not
bring our craft to the wind at once, we would either run her under,
or be swamped in attempting the man&oelig;uvre when the waves
got higher. The captain, however, with his usual submission to
the views of the wrong person, took the advice of the helmsman,
who happened to be older than I, and the schooner was allowed
to dash on either through or over the seas, at the speed of a
racer.</p>

<p>By this time the forward deck was always under water, and
the men gathered abaft the trunk to keep as dry as possible.
Officers and crew were huddled together pell-mell, and, with our
usual loose discipline, every body joined in the conversation and
counsel. Before sundown I again advised the laying-to of the
schooner; but the task had now become so formidable that the
men who dreaded the job, assured the captain that the wind
would fall as the moon arose. Yet, when the dim orb appeared
above the thick, low-drifting scud, the gale <i>increased</i>. The
light rather hinted than revealed the frightful scene around that
egg-shell on the lashed and furious sea. Each wave swept over
us, but our buoyant craft rose on the succeeding swell, and cleft
its crest with her knife-like prow. It was now too late to attempt
bringing her to the wind; still it became more urgent to
do something to prevent us from being submerged by the huge
seas, which came thundering after us like avalanches on our
quarters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
The perilous dilemma of our doubtful captain and his dainty
mate, may be easily imagined. Every body had an opinion, and
of course they vied with each other in absurdity;&mdash;at last some
one proposed to cut away the foresail, and bring her to the wind
under bare poles.</p>

<p>I was &ldquo;conning&rdquo; the schooner when this insane scheme was
broached, and fearing that the captain might adopt it, I leaped
on the hatch, after calling the boatswain to my place, and assured
the crew that if they severed the sail, we would lose command
of the vessel, so that with impaired headway, the next
wave that struck her would show her keel to the skies and her
dock to the fishes. I exhorted them to drive her <i>faster</i> if possible
rather than stop. To turn out the &ldquo;balance reef,&rdquo; I said,
was our only salvation;&mdash;and I alleged that I had seen a vessel
saved before in precisely the same way. Cowards, with death
clutching their throats, were soon convinced by a man of nerve.
I availed myself of the instantaneous silence that followed my
act, and before the captain could think or speak, I leaped to the
boom with my sharp knife, cutting the reef-points slowly and
carefully, so as not to allow the foresail to be inflated and torn by
a single blast.</p>

<p>My judgment was correct. Our increased canvas immediately
sent us skimming over the waves; the rollers no longer combed
dangerously over our quarter; we scudded steadily throughout
the remnant of the gale; and, next night, at sundown, we rested
on a quiet, lake-like ocean, taughtening the strained rigging, and
priding ourselves mightily on the hazards we encountered and
overcame. The Minorcan skipper was satisfied that no man ever
before performed so daring an exploit. He was, moreover, convinced,
that no one but himself could have carried the schooner
through so frightful a storm, or would have invented the noble
expedient of driving instead of stripping her!</p>

<p>From this hour all semblance of regular discipline was abandoned.
Sailors, who are suffered to tread the quarter-deck familiarly
and offer their opinions, never get over the permitted freedom. Our
ragamuffins of the Areostatico could never abide the idea that the
youngest seaman aboard,&mdash;and he, too, a <i>foreigner</i>,&mdash;should have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
proved the best sailor. The skilful performance of my duty was
the source of a rankling grudge. As I would not mix with the
scamps, they called me arrogant. My orders were negligently
obeyed; and, in fact, every thing in the schooner became as
comfortless as possible.</p>

<p>Forty-one days, however, brought us to the end of our voyage
at the mouth of the Rio Pongo. No one being acquainted with
the river&rsquo;s entrance or navigation, the captain and four hands
went ashore for a pilot, who came off in the afternoon, while our
master ascended in a boat to the slave-factory at Bangalang.
Four o&rsquo;clock found us entering the Rio Pongo, with tide and
wind in our favor, so that before the sun sank into the Atlantic
Ocean we were safe at our anchorage below the settlement.</p>

<p>While we were slowly drifting between the river banks, and
watching the gorgeous vegetation of Africa, which, that evening,
first burst upon my sight, I fell into a chat with the native pilot,
who had been in the United States, and spoke English remarkably
well. Berak very soon inquired whether there was any one
else on board who spoke the language besides myself, and when
told that the cabin-boy alone knew it, he whispered a story which,
in truth, I was not in the least surprised to hear.</p>

<p>That afternoon one of our crew had attempted the captain&rsquo;s
life, while on shore, by snapping a carabine behind his back!
Our pilot learned the fact from a native who followed the party
from the landing, along the beach; and its truth was confirmed,
in his belief, by the significant boasts made by the <i>tallest</i> of the
boatmen who accompanied him on board. He was satisfied that
the entire gang contemplated our schooner&rsquo;s seizure.</p>

<p>The pilot&rsquo;s story corroborated some hints I received from
our cook during the voyage. It struck me instantly, that if a
crime like this were really designed, no opportunity for its execution
could be more propitious than the present. I determined,
therefore, to omit no precaution that might save the vessel and
the lives of her honest officers. On examining the carabines
brought back from shore, which I had hurriedly thrown into the
arm-chest on deck, I found that the lock of this armory had been
forced, and several pistols and cutlasses abstracted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
Preparations had undoubtedly been made to assassinate us.
As night drew on, my judgment, as well as <i>nervousness</i>, convinced
me that the darkness would not pass without a murderous
attempt. There was an unusual silence. On reaching port,
there is commonly fun and merriment among crews; but the
usual song and invariable guitar were omitted from the evening&rsquo;s
entertainment. I searched the deck carefully, yet but two mariners
were found above the hatches apparently asleep. Inasmuch
as I was only a subordinate officer, I could not command, nor
had I any confidence in the nerve or judgment of the chief mate,
if I trusted my information to him. Still I deemed it a duty
to tell him the story, as well as my discovery about the missing
arms. Accordingly, I called the first officer, boatswain, and cook,
as quietly as possible, into the cabin; leaving our English cabin-boy
to watch in the companion way. Here I imparted our danger,
and asked their assistance in <i>striking the first blow</i>. My plan
was to secure the crew, and give them battle. The mate, as I
expected, shrank like a girl, declining any step till the captain
returned. The cook and boatswain, however, silently approved
my movement; so that we counselled our cowardly comrade to
remain below, while we assumed the responsibility and risk of
the enterprise.</p>

<p>It may have been rather rash, but I resolved to begin the
rescue, by shooting down, like a dog and without a word, the
notorious Cuban convict who had attempted the captain&rsquo;s life.
This, I thought, would strike panic into the mutineers; and
end the mutiny in the most bloodless way. Drawing a pair of
large horse-pistols from beneath the captain&rsquo;s pillow, and examining
the load, I ordered the cook and boatswain to follow me
to the deck. But the craven officer would not quit his hold on
my person. He besought me not to commit murder. He clung
to me with the panting fear and grasp of a woman. He begged
me, with every term of endearment, to desist; and, in the midst
of my scuffle to throw him off, one of the pistols accidentally exploded.
A moment after, my vigilant watch-boy screamed from
the starboard, a warning &ldquo;look-out!&rdquo; and, peering forward in the
blinding darkness as I emerged from the lighted cabin, I beheld the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
stalwart form of the ringleader, brandishing a cutlass within a
stride of me. I aimed and fired. We both fell; the mutineer
with two balls in his abdomen, and I from the recoil of an over-charged
pistol.</p>

<p>My face was cut, and my eye injured by the concussion; but
as neither combatant was deprived of consciousness, in a moment
we were both on our feet. The Spanish felon, however, pressed
his hand on his bowels, and rushed forward exclaiming he was
slain; but, in his descent to the forecastle, he was stabbed in
the shoulder with a bayonet by the boatswain, whose vigorous
blow drove the weapon with such tremendous force that it could
hardly be withdrawn from the scoundrel&rsquo;s carcass.</p>

<p>I said I was up in a minute; and, feeling my face with my
hand, I perceived a quantity of blood on my cheek, around which
I hastily tied a handkerchief, below my eyes. I then rushed to
the arm-chest. At that moment, the crack of a pistol, and a
sharp, boyish cry, told me that my pet was wounded beside me.
I laid him behind the hatchway, and returned to the charge.
By this time I was blind with rage, and fought, it seems, like a
<i>madman</i>. I confess that I have no personal recollection whatever
of the following events, and only learned them from the
subsequent report of the cook and boatswain.</p>

<p>I stood, they said, over the arm-chest like one spell-bound.
My eyes were fixed on the forecastle; and, as head after head
loomed out of the darkness above the hatch, I discharged carabine
after carabine at the mark. Every thing that moved fell by
my aim. As I fired the weapons, I flung them away to grasp
fresh ones: and, when the battle was over, the cook aroused me
from my mad stupor, still groping wildly for arms in the emptied
chest.</p>

<p>As the smoke cleared off, the fore part of our schooner seemed
utterly deserted: yet we found two men dead, one in mortal
agony on the deck, while the ringleader and a colleague were
gasping in the forecastle. Six pistols had been fired against us
from forward; but, strange to say, the only efficient ball was the
one that struck my English boy&rsquo;s leg.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
When I came to my senses, my first quest was for the gallant
boatswain, who, being unarmed on the forecastle when the unexpected
discharge took place, and seeing no chance of escape from
my murderous carabines, took refuge over the bows.</p>

<p>Our cabin-boy was soon quieted. The mutineers needed but
little care for their hopeless wounds, while the felon chief, like all
such wretches, died in an agony of despicable fear, shrieking for
pardon. My shriving of his sins was a speedy rite!</p>

<p>Such was my <i>first</i> night in Africa!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>There are casual readers who may consider the scene described
in the last chapter unnatural. It may be said that a youth,
whose life had been chequered by trials and disasters, but who
preserved a pure sensibility throughout them, is sadly distorted
when portrayed as expanding, at a leap, into a desperado. I
have but little to say in reply to these objections, save that <i>the
occurrences are perfectly true as stated</i>, and, moreover, that I
am satisfied they were only the natural developments of my
character.</p>

<p>From my earliest years I have adored nobility of soul, and
detested dishonor and treachery. I have passed through scenes
which will be hereafter told, that the world may qualify by harsh
names; yet I have striven to conduct myself throughout them,
not only with the ideas of fairness current among reckless men,
but with the truth that, under all circumstances, characterizes
an honorable nature.</p>

<p>Now, the tragedy of my first night on the Rio Pongo was
my transition from pupilage to responsible independence. I do
not allege in a boastful spirit that I was a man of courage; because
courage, or the want of it, are things for which a person
is no more responsible than he is for the possession or lack of
physical strength. I was, moreover, always a man of what I
may style <i>self-possessed passion</i>. I was endowed with something
more than cool energy; or, rather, cool energy was heightened
and sublimated by the fire of an ardent nature. Hitherto,
I had been tempered down by the habitual obedience to which I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
was subjected as a sailor under lawful discipline. But the
events of the last six months, and especially the gross relaxation
on the voyage to Africa, the risks we had run in navigating the
vessel, and the outlaws that surrounded me, not only kept my
mind for ever on the alert, but aroused my dormant nature to a
full sense of duty and self-protection.</p>

<p>Is it unnatural, then, for a man whose heart and nerves have
been laid bare for months, to quiver with agony and respond
with headlong violence, when imperilled character, property and
life, hang upon the fiat of his courageous promptitude? The
doubters may cavil over the philosophy, but I think I may
remain content with the fact. <i>I did my duty</i>&mdash;dreadful as
it was.</p>

<p>Let me draw a veil over our gory decks when the gorgeous
sun of Africa shot his first rays through the magnificent trees
and herbage that hemmed the placid river. Five bodies were
cast into the stream, and the traces of the tragedy obliterated as
well as possible. The recreant mate, who plunged into the
cabin at the report of the first pistol from the forecastle, reappeared
with haggard looks and trembling frame, to protest that
<i>he</i> had no hand in what he called &ldquo;the murder.&rdquo; The cook,
boatswain, and African pilot, recounted the whole transaction to
the master, who inserted it in the log-book, and caused me to sign
the narrative with unimplicated witnesses. Then the wound of
the cabin-boy was examined and found to be trifling, while mine,
though not painful, was thought to imperil my sight. The flint
lock of a rebounding pistol had inflicted three gashes, just beneath
the eye on my cheek.</p>

<p>There was but little appetite for breakfast that day. After
the story was told and recorded, we went sadly to work unmooring
the vessel, bringing her slowly like a hearse to an anchorage
in front of Bangalang, the residence and factory of Mr. Ormond,
better known by the country-name of &ldquo;Mongo John.&rdquo;
This personage came on board early in the morning with our
returned captain, and promised to send a native doctor to cure
both my eye and the boy&rsquo;s leg, making me pledge him a visit as
soon as the vessel&rsquo;s duties would permit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
That evening the specie was landed, and the schooner left in
my charge by the master, with orders to strip, repair, and provide
for the voyage home. Before night, Mongo John fulfilled
his promise of a physician, who came on board with his prescription,&mdash;not
in his pocket, but by his side! He ordered my torn
cheek to be bathed, every half-hour, <i>with human milk fresh
from the breast</i>; and, in order to secure a prompt, pure, and
plentiful supply, a stout negress and her infant were sent, with
orders to remain as long as her lacteal services might be required!
I cannot say whether nature or the remedy healed my
wound, but in a short time the flesh cicatrized, and all symptoms
of inflammation disappeared entirely.</p>

<p>It required ten days to put the Areostatico in ship-shape and
supply her with wood and water. Provisions had been brought
from Havana, so that it was only necessary we should stow them
in an accessible manner. As our schooner was extremely small,
we possessed no slave-deck; accordingly, mats were spread over
the fire-wood which filled the interstices of the water-casks, in
order to make an even surface for our cargo&rsquo;s repose.</p>

<p>When my tiresome task was done, I went ashore&mdash;almost for
the first time&mdash;to report progress to the master; but he was still
unprepared to embark his living freight. Large sums, far in
advance of the usual market, were offered by him for a cargo of
<i>boys</i>; still we were delayed full twenty days longer than our
contract required before a supply reached Bangalang.</p>

<p>As I had promised <i>Mongo John</i>, or John the Chief, to visit
his factory, I took this opportunity to fulfil my pledge. He
received me with elaborate politeness; showed me his town,
barracoons, and stores, and even stretched a point, to honor me
by an introduction to the <i>penetralia</i> of his <i>harem</i>. The visit
paid, he insisted that I should dine with him; and a couple
of choice bottles were quickly disposed of. Ormond, like
myself, had been a sailor. We spoke of the lands, scenes, and
adventures, each had passed through, while a fresh bottle was
called to fillip our memories. There is nothing so nourishing to
friendship as wine! Before sundown our electric memories had
circled the globe, and our intimacy culminated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg&nbsp;71]</a></span>
While the rosy fluid operated as a sedative on the Mongo,
and glued him to his chair in a comfortable nap, it had a contrary
effect on my exhilarated nerves. I strolled to the verandah
to get a breath of fresh air from the river, but soon dashed off
in the darkness to the sacred precincts of the <i>harem</i>! I was
not detected till I reached nearly the centre of the sanctuary
where Ormond confined his motley group of black, mulatto, and
quarteroon wives. The first dame who perceived me was a
bright mulatto, with rosy checks, sloe-like eyes, coquettish
turban, and most voluptuous mouth, whom I afterwards discovered
to be second in the chief&rsquo;s affections. In an instant the
court resounded with a chattering call to her companions, so that,
before I could turn, the whole band of gabbling parrots hemmed
me in with a deluge of talk. Fame had preceded me! My
sable nurse was a servant of the harem, and her visit to the
schooner, with the tale of the tragedy, supplied anecdotes for a
lifetime. Every body was on the <i>qui vive</i> to see the &ldquo;white
fighter.&rdquo; Every body was crazy to feel the &ldquo;white skin&rdquo; she
had healed. Then, with a sudden, childish freak of caprice,
they ran off from me as if afraid, and at once rushed back
again like a flock of glib-tongued and playful monkeys. I could
not comprehend a word they said; but the bevy squealed with
quite as much pleasure as if I did, and peered into my eyes for
answers, with impish devilry at my wondering ignorance.</p>

<p>At last, my sable friends seemed not only anxious to amuse
themselves but to do something for my entertainment also. A
chatter in a corner settled what it should be. Two or three
brought sticks, while two or three brought coals. A fire was
quickly kindled in the centre of the court; and as its flames lit
up the area, a whirling circle of half-stripped girls danced to the
monotonous beat of a <i>tom-tom</i>. Presently, the formal ring was
broken, and each female stepping out singly, danced according to
her individual fancy. Some were wild, some were soft, some
were tame, and some were fiery. After so many years I have no
distinct recollection of the characteristic movements of these
semi-savages, especially as the claret and champagne rather
fermented in my brain, and possessed me with the idea that it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
was my duty to mingle in the bounding throng. I resolved that
the barbarians should have a taste of Italian quality!</p>

<p>Accordingly, I leaped from the hammock where I had swung
idly during the scene, and, beginning with a <i>balancez</i> and an
<i>avant-deux</i>, terminated my terpsichorean exhibition by a regular
&ldquo;double shuffle&rdquo; and sailor&rsquo;s hornpipe. The delirious laughter,
cracked sides, rollicking fun, and outrageous merriment, with
which my feats were received, are unimaginable by sober-sided
people. Tired of my single exhibition, I seized the prettiest of
the group by her slim, shining waist, and whirled her round and
round the court in the quickest of waltzes, until, with a kiss, I
laid her giddy and panting on the floor. Then, grasping another,&mdash;another,&mdash;another,&mdash;and
another,&mdash;and treating each to
the same dizzy swim, I was about waltzing the whole <i>seraglio</i>
into quiescence, when who should rise before us but the staring
and yawning <i>Mongo</i>!</p>

<p>The apparition sobered me. A quarteroon pet of Ormond,&mdash;just
spinning into fashionable and luscious insensibility,&mdash;fell
from my arms into those of her master; and while I apologized
for the freak, I charged it altogether to the witchcraft of his wit
and wine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; said the Mongo, &ldquo;St. Vitus is in your Italian heels
the moment you are within hail of music and dancing; and, by
Jove, it seems you can scent a petticoat as readily as a hound
tracks runaways. But there&rsquo;s no harm in <i>dancing</i>, Don T&eacute;odore;
only hereafter I hope you will enjoy the amusement in a
less uproarious manner. In Africa we are fond of a <i>siesta</i> after
dinner; and I recommend you to get, as soon as possible, under
the lee of another bottle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We retired once more to his mahogany; and, under the spell
of my chieftain&rsquo;s claret and sea-yarns, I was soon lapped in delicious
sleep.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Next day the captain of the Areostatico drew me aside confidentially,
and hinted that Ormond had taken such a decided
fancy for me, and <i>insinuated</i> so warm a wish for my continuance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
<i>as his clerk</i> at Bangalang, that he thought it quite a duty,
though a sad one, to give his advice on the subject.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be well for your purse, Don T&eacute;odore, to stay with
so powerful a trader; but beside the improvement of your fortunes,
there are doubts whether it will be <i>wholesome</i> for you to
revisit Havana, at least at present. It may be said, <i>amigo mio</i>,
that you <i>commenced</i> the warfare on board the schooner;&mdash;and as
five men were slain in the affray, it will be necessary for me to
report the fact to the <i>commandante</i> as soon as I arrive. Now
it is true, <i>hijo mio</i>, that you saved the vessel, cargo, specie, and
my cousin; yet, God knows what may be the result of Havana
justice. You will have a rigid examination, and I rather think
you will be <i>imprisoned</i> until the final decision is made. When
that consummation shall occur is quite uncertain. If you have
friends, they will be bled as long as possible before you get out;
if you have none, no one will take pains to see you released without
recompense. When you see daylight once more, the rest of
these ragamuffins and the felon friends of the dead men, will begin
to dog your steps, and make Havana uncomfortable as well
as dangerous; so that I have no hesitation in recommending you
to stay where you are, and take the doubloons of the Mongo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought I saw at a glance the drift of this hypocritical <i>fanfaronade</i>,
and was satisfied he only desired to get rid of me in
order to reinstate the chief mate in a situation which he surely
could not occupy as long as I was on board. As I meant to stay
in Africa, I told him at once that I grieved because he had not
spoken his wishes openly, boldly, and honestly, like a man, but
had masked an ungrateful cowardice by hypocritical solicitude
for my welfare. I departed abruptly with a scowl of contempt;
and as he hastened to hide his blanched face in the cabin, I
called a boat, and throwing my sea chest, bedding, and arms,
aboard, committed my fate to the African continent. <i>A half-hour
turned and decided my fate!</i></p>

<p>Mr. Ormond received me very cordially, and, installing me
in my new secretaryship, promised a private establishment, a
seat at his table, and a negro per month,&mdash;or its value at the
rate of forty dollars,&mdash;for my services.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
When the runners returned from the interior with the slaves
required to complete the Areostatico&rsquo;s cargo, I considered it my
duty to the Italian grocer of Regla to dispatch his vessel personally.
Accordingly, I returned on board to aid in stowing <i>one
hundred and eight boys and girls, the eldest of whom did not
exceed fifteen years</i>! As I crawled between decks, I confess I
could not imagine how this little army was to be packed or draw
breath in a hold but <i>twenty-two inches high</i>! Yet the experiment
was promptly made, inasmuch as it was necessary to secure
them below in descending the river, in order to prevent their
leaping overboard and swimming ashore. I found it impossible
to adjust the whole in a sitting posture; but we made them lie
down in each other&rsquo;s laps, like <i>sardines</i> in a can, and in this way
obtained space for the entire cargo. Strange to tell, when the
Areostatico reached Havana, but <i>three</i> of these &ldquo;passengers&rdquo;
had paid the debt of nature.</p>

<p>As I left the schooner a few miles outside the bar, I crossed
her side without an adieu save for the English cabin-boy, whose
fate I was pained to intrust to these stupid Spaniards. Indeed,
the youth almost belonged to me, for I may say he owed his life
to my interference.</p>

<p>Previous to the voyage, while waiting in the harbor of Havana
for a crew, our vessel was anchored near the wharves, next
to an English merchantman. One afternoon I heard a scream
from the neighboring craft, and perceived a boy rush from
the cabin with his face dyed in blood. He was instantly pursued
by a burly seaman, inflicting blows with his fist. I implored the
brute to desist, but my interference seemed to augment his choler
to such a degree, that he seized a handspike to knock the
stripling down. Upon this I called the child to leap overboard,
at the same time commanding a hand to lower my boat and scull
in the direction of his fall. The boy obeyed my voice; and in a
few minutes I had him on board blessing me for his safety. But
the drunken Briton vented his rage in the most indecent language;
and had his boat been aboard, I doubt not a summary
visit would have terminated in a fight on my deck.</p>

<p>However, as good luck would have it, his skiff was at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
landing, so that there was ample time, before he could reach the
Areostatico, to tie up the bruised face and broken rib of the
child, and to conceal him in the house of a Spanish crone in
Havana, who cured the maladies of credulous seamen by
witchcraft!</p>

<p>After nightfall the master of the British vessel came aboard
to claim his boy; but as he was petulant and seemed disposed to
carry matters with a high hand, my temper rose in resistance,
and I refused to release the child until he sealed with an oath
his promise to treat him better in future. But the cruel scoundrel
insisted on <i>unconditional</i> surrender; and to end the controversy,
I was compelled to order him off the schooner.</p>

<p>British pluck of course would not allow a captain to be deprived
so easily of his property, so the British consul was invoked
to appeal to the captain of the port. This personage summoned
me before him, and listened calmly to a story which
added no honor to English mariners. In my last interview with
the boy he implored my continued protection and concealment;
so that when the Spanish official declared&mdash;notwithstanding the
officer&rsquo;s conduct&mdash;that the vessel was entitled to her crew, and
that I must surrender the child, I excused myself from complying
by pleading utter ignorance of his whereabout. In view of
this contingency, I directed the woman to hide him in a place of
which I should be ignorant. So I told no lie, and saved the boy
from his tyrant.</p>

<p>The inquiry was dropped at this stage of proceedings. When
the British vessel sailed a few days after, I caused the youth
to be brought from his concealment; and, with our captain&rsquo;s
consent, brought him aboard to serve in our cabin.</p>

<p>I have narrated this little episode in consequence of my love
for the boy, and because <i>he was the only English subject I ever
knew to ship in a slaver</i>.</p>

<p>I requested the Areostatico&rsquo;s owners to pay him liberally for
his fidelity when he got back to Havana; and I was happy to
learn next year, that they not only complied with my request,
but sent him home to his friends in Liverpool.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>When I got back to Bangalang, my first movement was to take
possession of the quarters assigned me by the Mongo, and to
make myself as comfortable as possible in a land whose chief requirements
are shade and shelter. My house, built of cane plastered
with mud, consisted of two earthen-floored rooms and a
broad verandah. The thatched roof was rather leaky, while my
furniture comprised two arm-chests covered with mats, a deal
table, a bamboo settle, a tin-pan with palm-oil for a lamp, and a
German looking-glass mounted in a paper frame. I augmented
these comforts by the addition of a trunk, mattress, hammock
and pair of blankets; yet, after all this embellishment, I confess
my household was rather a sorry affair.</p>

<p>It is time I should make the reader acquainted with the individual
who was the presiding genius of the scene, and, in some
degree, a type of his peculiar class in Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Ormond was the son of an opulent slave-trader from
Liverpool, and owed his birth to the daughter of a native chief
on the Rio Pongo. His father seems to have been rather proud
of his mulatto stripling, and dispatched him to England to be
educated. But Master John had made little progress in belles-lettres,
when news of the trader&rsquo;s death was brought to the
British agent, who refused the youth further supplies of money.
The poor boy soon became an outcast in a land which had not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
yet become fashionably addicted to philanthropy; and, after
drifting about awhile in England, he shipped on board a merchantman.
The press-gang soon got possession of the likely
mulatto for the service of his Britannic Majesty. Sometimes he
played the part of dandy waiter in the cabin; sometimes he
swung a hammock with the hands in the forecastle. Thus, five
years slipped by, during which the wanderer visited most of the
West Indian and Mediterranean stations.</p>

<p>At length the prolonged cruise was terminated, and Ormond
paid off. He immediately determined to employ his hoarded
cash in a voyage to Africa, where he might claim his father&rsquo;s
property. The project was executed; his mother was still found
alive; and, fortunately for the manly youth, she recognized him
at once as her first-born.</p>

<p>The reader will recollect that these things occurred on the
west coast of Africa in the early part of the present century,
and that the tenure of property, and the interests of foreign
traders, were controlled entirely by such <i>customary</i> laws as prevailed
on the spot. Accordingly, a &ldquo;grand palaver&rdquo; was appointed,
and all Mr. Ormond&rsquo;s brothers, sisters, uncles, and
cousins,&mdash;many of whom were in possession of his father&rsquo;s slaves
or their descendants,&mdash;were summoned to attend. The &ldquo;talk&rdquo;
took plate at the appointed time. The African mother stood
forth stanchly to assert the identity and rights of her first-born,
and, in the end, all of the Liverpool trader&rsquo;s property, in houses,
lands, and negroes, that could be ascertained, was handed over,
according to coast-law, to the returned heir.</p>

<p>When the mulatto youth was thus suddenly elevated into
comfort, if not opulence, in his own country, he resolved to augment
his wealth by pursuing his father&rsquo;s business. But the
whole country was then desolated by a civil war, occasioned, as
most of them are, by family disputes, which it was necessary to
terminate before trade could be comfortably established.</p>

<p>To this task Ormond steadfastly devoted his first year. His
efforts were seconded by the opportune death of one of the warring
chiefs. A tame opponent,&mdash;a brother of Ormond&rsquo;s mother,&mdash;was
quickly brought to terms by a trifling present; so that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
sailor boy soon concentrated the family influence, and declared
himself &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mongo</span>,&rdquo; or, Chief of the River.</p>

<p>Bangalang had long been a noted factory among the English
traders. When war was over, Ormond selected this post as his
permanent residence, while he sent runners to Sierra Leone and
Goree with notice that he would shortly be prepared with ample
cargoes. Trade, which had been so long interrupted by hostilities,
poured from the interior. Vessels from Goree and Sierra
Leone were seen in the offing, responding to his invitation. His
stores were packed with British, French, and American fabrics;
while hides, wax, palm-oil, ivory, gold, and slaves, were the native
products for which Spaniards and Portuguese hurried to
proffer their doubloons and bills.</p>

<p>It will be readily conjectured that a very few years sufficed
to make Jack Ormond not only a wealthy merchant, but a popular
Mongo among the great interior tribes of Foulahs and Mandingoes.
The petty chiefs, whose territory bordered the sea,
flattered him with the title of king; and, knowing his <i>Mormon
taste</i>, stocked his <i>harem</i> with their choicest children as the most
valuable tokens of friendship and fidelity.</p>

<p>When I was summoned to act as secretary or clerk of such a
personage, I saw immediately that it would be well not only to
understand my duties promptly, but to possess a clear estimate
of the property I was to administer and account for. Ormond&rsquo;s
easy habits satisfied me that he was not a man of business originally,
or had become sadly negligent under the debasing influence
of wealth and voluptuousness. My earliest task, therefore,
was to make out a <i>minute inventory</i> of his possessions,
while I kept a watchful eye on his stores, never allowing any
one to enter them unattended. When I presented this document,
which exhibited a large deficiency, the Mongo received it with
indifference, begging me not to &ldquo;annoy him with accounts.&rdquo;
His manner indicated so much petulant fretfulness, that I augured
from it the conscious decline or disorder of his affairs.</p>

<p>As I was returning to the warehouse from this mortifying
interview, I encountered an ancient hag,&mdash;a sort of superintendent
Cerberus or manager of the Mongo&rsquo;s <i>harem</i>,&mdash;who, by signs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
intimated that she wanted the key to the &ldquo;cloth-chest,&rdquo; whence
she immediately helped herself to several fathoms of calico.
The crone could not speak English, and, as I did not understand
the Soosoo dialect, we attempted no oral argument about the
propriety of her conduct; but, taking a pencil and paper, and
making signs that she should go to the Mongo, who would write
an order for the raiment, I led her quietly to the door. The
wrath of the virago was instantly kindled, while her horrid face
gleamed with that devilish ferocity, which, in some degree is lost
by Africans who dwell on our continent. During the reign of
my predecessors, it seems that she had been allowed to control
the store keys, and to help herself unstintedly. I knew not, of
course, what she <i>said</i> on this occasion; but the violence of her
gestures, the nervous spasms of her limbs, the flashing of her
eyes, the scream of her voluble tongue, gave token that she
swelled with a rage which was augmented by my imperturbable
quietness. At dinner, I apprised Mr. Ormond of the negro&rsquo;s
conduct; but he received the announcement with the same laugh
of indifference that greeted the account of his deficient inventory.</p>

<p>That night I had just stretched myself on my hard pallet,
and was revolving the difficulties of my position with some degree
of pain at my forced continuance in Africa, when my servant
tapped softly at the door, and announced that some one
demanded admittance, but begged that I would first of all extinguish
the light. I was in a country requiring caution; so I
felt my pistols before I undid the latch. It was a bright, star-light
night; and, as I opened the door sufficiently to obtain a
glance beyond,&mdash;still maintaining my control of the aperture,&mdash;I
perceived the figure of a female, wrapped in cotton cloth from
head to foot, except the face, which I recollected as that of the
beautiful <i>quarteroon</i> I was whirling in the waltz, when surprised
by the Mongo. She put forth her hands from the folds
of her garment, and laying one softly on my arm, while she
touched her lips with the other, looked wistfully behind, and
glided into my apartment.</p>

<p>This poor girl, the child of a mulatto mother and a white
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
parent, was born in the settlement of Sierra Leone, and had
acquired our language with much more fluency than is common
among her race. It was said that her father had been originally
a missionary from Great Britain, but abandoned his profession
for the more lucrative traffic in slaves, to which he owed an
abundant fortune. It is probable that the early ecclesiastical
turn of her delinquent progenitor induced him, before he departed
for America, to bestow on his child the biblical name of
<span class="smcap">Esther</span>.</p>

<p>I led my trembling visitor to the arm-chest, and, seating her
gently by my side, inquired why I was favored by so stealthy a
visit from the <i>harem</i>. My suspicions were aroused; for, though
a novice in Africa, I knew enough of the discipline maintained in
these slave factories, not to allow my fancy to seduce me with the
idea that her visit was owing to mad-cap sentimentality.</p>

<p>The manner of these <i>quarteroon</i> girls, whose complexion
hardly separates them from our own race, is most winningly graceful;
and Esther, with abated breath, timidly asked my pardon for
intruding, while she declared I had made so bitter an enemy of
Unga-golah,&mdash;the head-woman of the seraglio,&mdash;that, in spite of
danger, she stole to my quarters with a warning. Unga swore
revenge. I had insulted and thwarted her; I was able to thwart
her at all times, if I remained the Mongo&rsquo;s &ldquo;book-man;&rdquo;&mdash;I
must soon &ldquo;go to another country;&rdquo; but, if I did not, I would
quickly find the food of Bangalang excessively unwholesome!
&ldquo;Never eat any thing that a Mandingo offers you,&rdquo; said Esther.
&ldquo;Take your meals exclusively from the Mongo&rsquo;s table. Unga-golah
knows all the Mandingo <i>jujus</i>, and she will have no
scruple in using them in order to secure once more the control
of the store keys. Good night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this she rose to depart, begging me to be silent about
her visit, and to believe that a poor slave could feel true kindness
for a white man, or even expose herself to save him.</p>

<p>If an unruly passion had tugged at my heartstrings, the soft
appeal, the liquid tones, the tenderness of this girl&rsquo;s humanity,
would have extinguished it in an instant. It was the first time
for many a long and desolate mouth that I had experienced the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
gentle touch of a woman&rsquo;s hand, or felt the interest of mortal
solicitude fall like a refreshing dew upon my heart! Who will
censure me for halting on my door-sill as I led her forth, retaining
her little hand in mine, while I cast my eyes over the lithe
symmetry of those slender and rounded limbs; while I feasted
on the flushed magnolia of those beautiful cheeks, twined my
fingers in the trailing braids of that raven hair, peered into the
blackness of those large and swimming orbs, felt a tear trickle
down my hardening face, and left, on those coral lips, the print
of a kiss that was fuller of gratitude than passion!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Nowadays that Mormonism is grafting a &ldquo;celestial wifery&rdquo;
upon the civilization of the nineteenth century, I do not think it
amiss to recall the memory of those African establishments which
formed so large a portion of a trader&rsquo;s homestead. It is not to
be supposed that the luxurious <i>harem</i> of Turkey or Egypt was
transferred to the Guinea coast, or that its lofty walls were barricaded
by stout gates, guarded by troops of sable eunuchs. The
&ldquo;wifery&rdquo; of my employer was a bare inclosure, formed by a
quadrangular cluster of mud-houses, the entrance to whose court-yard
was never watched save at night. Unga-golah, the eldest
and least delectable of the dames, maintained the establishment&rsquo;s
police, assigned gifts or servants to each female, and distributed
her master&rsquo;s favors according to the bribes she was cajoled by.</p>

<p>In early life and during his gorged prosperity, Ormond,&mdash;a
stout, burly, black-eyed, broad-shouldered, short-necked man,&mdash;ruled
his <i>harem</i> with the rigid decorum of the East. But as
age and misfortunes stole over the sensual voluptuary, his mental
and bodily vigor became impaired, not only by excessive drink,
but by the narcotics to which he habitually resorted for excitement.
When I became acquainted with him, his face and figure
bore the marks of a worn-out <i>debauch&eacute;</i>. His harem now was
a fashion of the country rather than a domestic resort. His wives
ridiculed him, or amused themselves as they pleased. I learned
from Esther that there was hardly one who did not &ldquo;flirt&rdquo; with
a lover in Bangalang, and that Unga-golah was blinded by gifts,
while the stupor of the Mongo was perpetuated by liquor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
It may be supposed that in such a <i>seraglio</i>, and with such a
master, there were but few matrimonial jealousies; still, as it
would be difficult to find, even in our most Christian society, two
females without some lurking bitterness towards rivals, so it is
not to be imagined that the Mongo&rsquo;s mansion was free from
womanly quarrels. These disputes chiefly occurred when Ormond
distributed gifts of calico, beads, tobacco, pipes and looking-glasses.
If the slightest preference or inequality was shown,
adieu to order. Unga-golah descended below zero! The favorite
wife, outraged by her neglected authority, became furious;
and, for a season, pandemonium was let loose in Bangalang.</p>

<p>One of these scenes of passion occurs to me as I write. I
was in the store with the Mongo when an aggrieved dame, not
remarkable either for delicacy of complexion or sweetness of
odor, entered the room, and marching up with a swagger to her
master, dashed a German looking-glass on the floor at his feet.
She wanted a larger one, for the glass bestowed on her was half
an inch smaller than the gifts to her companions.</p>

<p>When Ormond was sober, his pride commonly restrained him
from allowing the women to molest his leisure; so he quietly
turned from the virago and ordered her out of the store.</p>

<p>But my lady was not to be appeased by dignity like this.
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; shrieked the termagant, as she wrenched off her handkerchief.
&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; yelled she, tearing off one sleeve, and then
the other. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; screamed the fiend, kicking a shoe into one
corner, and the other shoe into another corner. &ldquo;Ha! Mongo!&rdquo;
roared the beldame, as she stripped every garment from her
body and stood absolutely <i>naked</i> before us, slapping her wool,
cheeks, forehead, breasts, arms, stomach and limbs, and appealing
to Ormond to say where she was deficient in charms, that
she should be slighted half an inch on a looking-glass?</p>

<p>As the Mongo was silent, she strode up to me for an opinion;
but, scarlet with blushes, I dived behind the cloth-chest, and
left the laughing Ormond to gratify the whim of the &ldquo;<i>model
artiste</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Years afterwards, I remember seeing an infuriate Ethiopian
fling her infant into the fire because its white father preferred the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
child of another spouse. Indeed, I was glad my station at Bangalang
did not make it needful for the preservation of my respectability
that I should indulge in the luxury of <i>African matrimony</i>!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>But these exhibitions of jealous passion were not excited
alone by the unequal distribution of presents from the liege lord
of Bangalang. I have observed that Ormond&rsquo;s wives took
advantage of his carelessness and age, to seek congenial companionship
outside the <i>harem</i>. Sometimes the preference of two of
these sable <i>belles</i> alighted on the same lover, and then the battle
was transferred from a worthless looking-glass to the darling
<i>beau</i>. When such a quarrel arose, a meeting between the rivals
was arranged out of the Mongo&rsquo;s hearing; when, throwing off
their waist-cloths, the controversy was settled between the
female gladiators without much damage. But, now and then,
the matter was not left to the ladies. The sable lovers themselves
took up the conflict, and a regular challenge passed between
the gay Othellos.</p>

<p>At the appointed time, the duellists appeared upon &ldquo;the
field of honor&rdquo; accompanied by friends who were to witness their
victory or sympathize in their defeat. Each stalwart savage
leaped into the arena, armed with a cow-hide cat, whose sharp
and triple thongs were capable of inflicting the harshest blows.
They stripped, and tossed three <i>cowries</i> into the air to determine
which of the two should receive the first lashing. The unfortunate
loser immediately took his stand, and received, with the
firmness of a martyr, the allotted number of blows. Then came
the turn of the whipper, who, with equal constancy, offered his
back to the scourge of the enraged sufferer. Thus they alternated
until one gave in, or until the bystanders decreed victory
to him who bore the punishment longest without wincing. The
flayed backs of these &ldquo;chivalrous men of honor&rdquo; were ever after
displayed in token of bravery; and, doubtless, their Dulcineas
devoted to their healing the subtlest ointment and tenderest
affection recognized among Africans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>My business habits and systematic devotion to the Mongo&rsquo;s interests
soon made me familiar with the broad features of &ldquo;country
trade;&rdquo; but as I was still unable to speak the coast dialects,
Mr. Ormond&mdash;who rarely entered the warehouse or conversed
about commerce&mdash;supplied an adroit interpreter, who stood
beside me and assisted in the retail of foreign merchandise, for
rice, ivory, palm-oil, and domestic provisions. The purchase of
slaves and gold was conducted exclusively by the Mongo, who
did not consider me sufficiently initiated in native character and
tricks to receive so delicate a trust.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Long and dreary were the days and nights of the apparently
interminable &ldquo;wet season.&rdquo; Rain in a city, rain in the country,
rain in a village, rain at sea, are sufficiently wearying, even
to those whose mental activity is amused or occupied by books or
the concerns of life; but who can comprehend the insufferable
lassitude and despondency that overwhelm an African resident,
as he lies on his mat-covered arm-chest, and listens to the endless
deluge pouring for days, weeks, months, upon his leaky thatch?</p>

<p>At last, however, the season of rain passed by, and the &ldquo;dry
season&rdquo; set in. This was the epoch for the arrival of caravans
from the interior; so that we were not surprised when our runners
appeared, with news that <span class="smcap">Ahmah-de-Bellah</span>, son of a noted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
Fullah chief, was about to visit the Rio Pongo with an imposing
train of followers and merchandise. The only means of communication
with the interior of Africa are, for short distances, by
rivers, and, for longer ones, by &ldquo;paths&rdquo; or &ldquo;trails&rdquo; leading
through the dense forest and among the hills, to innumerable
&ldquo;towns&rdquo; that stud this prolific land. Stephenson and McAdam
have not been to Africa, and there are neither turnpikes nor
railways. Now, when the coast-traders of the west are apprised
that caravans are threading their way towards the Atlantic shores,
it is always thought advisable to make suitable preparations for
the chiefs, and especially to greet them by messages, before their
arrival at the beach. Accordingly, &ldquo;<i>barkers</i>&rdquo; are sent forth on the
forest &ldquo;paths&rdquo; to welcome the visitors with gifts of tobacco and
powder. &ldquo;<i>Barkers</i>&rdquo; are colored gentlemen, with fluent tongues
and flexible consciences, always in the train of factories on the
coast, who hasten to the wilderness at the first signal of a caravan&rsquo;s
approach, and magnify the prosperity and merchandise of
their patrons with as much zeal and veracity as the &ldquo;drummers&rdquo;
of more Christian lands.</p>

<p>A few days after our band of travelling agents had departed
on their mission, the crack of fire-arms was heard from the hills
in our rear, signifying that the Mongo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>barkers</i>&rdquo; had been
successful with the caravan in tow. A prompt response to the
joyous signal was made by our cannons; so that, after half an
hour&rsquo;s firing, Ahmah-de-Bellah and his party emerged from the
smoke, marshalled by our band of singers, who preceded him,
chanting with loud voices the praise of the youthful chieftain.
Behind the master came the principal traders and their slaves
laden with produce, and followed by forty captive negroes,
secured by bamboo withes. These were succeeded by three-score
bullocks, a large flock of sheep or goats, and the females
of the party; while the procession was closed by the demure
tread of a tame and stately <span class="smcap">Ostrich</span>!</p>

<p>It was the first time I had seen so odd an assemblage of
beasts and humanity. Indeed, had the troupe been accompanied
by a bevy of ourang-outangs, I confess I might, at times, have
had difficulty in deciding the grade of animal life to which the
object in front of me belonged.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
Mr. Ormond, when put upon his mettle, was one of the
ablest traders in Africa, and received the Mahometan strangers
with becoming state. He awaited Ahmah-de-Bellah and his committee
of head-traders on the piazza of his receiving-house, which
was a rather stately edifice, one hundred and fifty feet in length,
built to be fire-proof for the protection of our stores. When
each Fullah stranger was presented, he shook hands and
&ldquo;snapped fingers&rdquo; with the Mongo several times; and, as every
petty peddler in the train wanted to <i>salaam</i>, the &ldquo;white man for
good luck,&rdquo; the process of presentation occupied at least an hour.</p>

<p>According to coast custom, as soon as these compliments were
over, the caravan&rsquo;s merchandise was deposited within our walls,
not only for security, but in order that we might gauge the <i>value
of the welcome</i> the owners were entitled to receive. This precaution,
though ungallant, is extremely necessary, inasmuch as
many of the interior dealers were in the habit of declaring, on
arrival, the value of their gold and ivory to be much greater than
it was in fact, in order to receive a more liberal &ldquo;present.&rdquo;
Even savages instinctively acquire the tricks of trade!</p>

<p>When the goods were stored, a couple of fat bullocks, with
an abundant supply of rice, were given to the visitors, and the
chiefs of the caravan were billeted upon our townspeople. The
<i>canaille</i> built temporary huts for themselves in the outskirts;
while Ahmah-de-Bellah, a strict Mahometan, accompanied by two
of his wives, was furnished with a pair of neat houses that had
been hastily fitted up with new and elegant mats.<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>While the merchandise of these large caravans is unpaid for,
their owners, by the custom of the country, remain a costly burden
upon the factories. We were naturally anxious to be free
from this expense as soon as possible, and gave notice next morning
that &ldquo;trade would begin forthwith.&rdquo; Ahmah-de-Bellah, the
chiefs of the caravans, and Mr. Ormond, at once entered into
negotiations, so that by nightfall a bargain had been struck, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
only for their presents, but for the price of merchandise, and the
percentage to be retained as &ldquo;native duty.&rdquo; Such a preliminary
liquidation with <i>the heads</i> of a caravan is ever indispensable, for,
without their assistance, it would be out of the question to traffic
with the ragamuffins who hang on the skirts of opulent chieftains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
Each morning, at daylight, a crier went through the town,
announcing the character of the specific trade which would be
carried on during hours of business. One day it was in hides;
another, rice; another, cattle. When these were disposed of, a
time was specially appointed for the exchange of gold, ivory and
slaves; and, at the agreed hour, Mr. Ormond, Ahmah-de-Bellah,
and myself, locked the doors of the warehouse, and traded
through a window, while our &ldquo;barkers&rdquo; distributed the goods
to the Africans, often using their whips to keep the chattering
and disputatious scamps in order. Ahmah-de-Bellah pretended
to inspect the measurement of cloth, powder and tobacco, to insure
justice to his compatriots; but, in reality, like a true tax-gatherer,
he was busy ascertaining his lawful percentage on the
sale, in return for the protection from robbery he gave the petty
traders on their pilgrimage to the coast.</p>

<p>At length the market was cleared of sellers and merchandise&mdash;except
the ostrich, which, when all was over, reached the Mongo&rsquo;s
hands as a royal gift from the Ali-Mami of Footha-Yallon,
the pious father of Ahmah-de-Bellah. The bird, it is true, was
presented as a free offering; yet it was hinted that the worthy
Ali stood in need of reliable muskets, which his son would take
charge of on the journey home. As twenty of those warlike instruments
were dispatched by Ahmah-de-Bellah, the ostrich became
rather a costly as well as characteristic gift. Each of the
traders, moreover, expected a &ldquo;bungee&rdquo; or &ldquo;dash&rdquo; of some
sort, in token of good will, and in proportion to his sales; so that
we hastened to comply with all the common-law customs of the
country, in order to liberate Bangalang from the annoying
crowd. They dropped off rapidly as they were paid; and in a
short time Ahmah-de-Bellah, his wives, and immediate followers,
were all that remained of the seven hundred Fullahs.</p>

<p>Ahmah-de-Bellah was a fine specimen of what may be considered
&ldquo;Young Africa,&rdquo; though he can hardly be classed among
the progressives or revolutionary propagandists of the age. In
person he was tall, graceful, and commanding. As the son of
an important chief, he had been free from those menial toils
which, in that climate, soon obliterate all intellectual characteristics.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
His face was well formed for an African&rsquo;s. His high
and broad brow arched over a straight nose, while his lips had
nothing of that vulgar grossness which gives so sensual an expression
to his countrymen. Ahmah&rsquo;s manners to strangers or superiors
were refined and courteous in a remarkable degree; but to
the mob of the coast and inferiors generally, he manifested that
harsh and peremptory tone which is common among the savages
of a fiery clime.</p>

<p>Ahmah-de-Bellah was second son of the Ali-Mami, or King
of Footha-Yallon, who allowed him to exercise the prerogative
of leading for the first time, a caravan to the seaboard, in honor
of attaining the discreet age of &ldquo;twenty four rainy seasons.&rdquo;
The privilege however, was not granted without a view to profit
by the courage of his own blood; for the Ali-Mami was never
known to suffer a son or relative to depart from his jurisdiction
without a promise of <i>half</i> the products of the lucrative enterprise.</p>

<p>The formation of a caravan, when the king&rsquo;s permission has
been finally secured, is a work of time and skill. At the beginning
of the &ldquo;dry season,&rdquo; the privileged chieftain departs with
power of life and death over his followers, and &ldquo;squats&rdquo; in one
of the most frequented &ldquo;paths&rdquo; to the sea, while he dispatches
small bands of daring retainers to other trails throughout the
neighborhood, to blockade every passage to the beach. The siege
of the highways is kept up with vigor for a month or more, by
these black Rob Roys and Robin Hoods, until a sufficient number
of traders may be trapped to constitute a valuable caravan, and give
importance to its leader. While this is the main purpose of the
forest adventure, the occasion is taken advantage of to collect a
local tribute, due by small tribes to the Ali, which could not be
obtained otherwise. The despotic officer, moreover, avails himself
of the blockade to stop malefactors and absconding debtors.
Goods that are seized in the possession of the latter may be sequestrated
to pay his creditors; but if their value is not equal
to the debt, the delinquent, if a pagan, is sold as a slave, but is
let off with a <i>bastinado</i>, if he proves to be &ldquo;one of the faithful.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
It is natural to suppose that every effort is made by the
small traders of the interior to avoid these savage press-gangs.
The poor wretches are not only subjected to annoying vassalage
by ruffian princes, but the blockade of the forest often diverts
them from the point they originally designed to reach,&mdash;forces
them to towns or factories they had no intention of visiting,&mdash;and,
by extreme delay, wastes their provisions and diminishes
their frugal profits. It is surprising to see how admirably even
savages understand and exercise the powers of sovereignty and
the rights of transit!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>While Ahmah-de-Bellah tarried at Bangalang, it was my habit
to visit him every night to hear his interesting chat, as it was
translated by an interpreter. Sometimes, in return, I would
recount the adventures of my sea-faring life, which seemed to
have a peculiar flavor for this child of the wilderness, who now
gazed for the first time on the ocean. Among other things, I
strove to convince him of the world&rsquo;s rotundity; but, to the last,
he smiled incredulously at my daring assertion, and closed the
argument by asking me to prove it from the Koran? He allowed
me the honors due a traveller and &ldquo;book-man;&rdquo; but a
mind that had swallowed, digested, and remembered every text
of Mahomet&rsquo;s volume, was not to be deceived by such idle fantasies.
He kindly undertook to conquer my ignorance of his creed
by a careful exposition of its mysteries in several long-winded
lectures, and I was so patient a listener, that I believe Ahmah
was entirely satisfied of my conversion.</p>

<p>My seeming acquiescence was well repaid by the Fullah&rsquo;s
confidence. He returned my nightly calls with interest; and,
visiting me in the warehouse during hours of business, became
so fervently wrapped up in my spiritual salvation, that he would
spout Mahometanism for hours through an interpreter. To
get rid of him, one day, I promised to follow the Prophet
with pleasure if he consented to receive me; but I insisted on
entering the &ldquo;fold of the faithful&rdquo; <i>without</i> submitting to the
peculiar rite of Mussulman baptism!</p>

<p>Ahmah-de-Bellah took the jest kindly, laughing like a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
fellow, and from that day forward, we were sworn cronies. The
Fullah at once wrote down a favorite prayer in Arabic, requiring
as my spiritual guide, that I should commit it to memory for
constant and ready use. After a day or two, he examined me
in the ritual; but, finding I was at fault after the first sentence,
reproached me pathetically upon my negligence and exhorted
me to repentance,&mdash;much to the edification of our interpreter,
who was neither Jew, Christian, nor Mussulman.</p>

<p>But the visit of the young chieftain, which began in trade
and tapered off in piety, drew to a close. Ahmah-de-Bellah
began to prepare for his journey homeward. As the day of departure
approached, I saw that my joke had been taken seriously
by the Fullah, and that he <i>relied</i> upon my apostasy. At the
last moment, Ahmah tried to put me to a severe test, by
suddenly producing the holy book, and requiring me to seal our
friendship by an oath that I would never abandon Islamism. I
contrived, however, adroitly to evade the affirmation by feigning
an excessive anxiety to acquire more profound knowledge of the
Koran, before I made so solemn a pledge.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>It came to pass that, out of the forty slaves brought in the
caravan, the Mongo rejected eight. After some altercation,
Ahmah-de-Bellah consented to discard seven; but he insisted
that the remaining veteran should be shipped, as he could neither
<i>kill</i> nor send him back to Footha-Yallon.</p>

<p>I was somewhat curious to know the crime this culprit had
committed, which was so heinous as to demand his perpetual
exile, though it spared his life. The chief informed me that the
wretch had slain his son; and, as there was no punishment for
such an offence assigned by the Koran, the judges of his country
condemned him to be sold <i>a slave to Christians</i>,&mdash;a penalty
they considered worse than death.</p>

<p>Another curious feature of African law was developed in the
sale of this caravan. I noticed a couple of women drawn along
with ropes around their necks, while others of their sex and class
were suffered to wander about without bonds. These females,
the chief apprised us, would have been burnt in his father&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
domains for witchcraft, had not his venerable ancestor been so
much distressed for powder that he thought their lives would be
more valuable to his treasury than their carcasses to outraged
law.</p>

<p>It was a general complaint among the companions of Ahmah-de-Bellah
that the caravan was scant of slaves in consequence of
this unfortunate lack of powder. The young chieftain promised
better things in future. Next year, the Mongo&rsquo;s barracoons
should teem with his conquests. When the &ldquo;rainy season&rdquo;
approached, the Ali-Mami, his father, meant to carry on a
&ldquo;great war&rdquo; against a variety of small tribes, whose captives
would replenish the herds, that, two years before, had been carried
off by a sudden blight.</p>

<p>I learned from my intelligent Fullah, that while the Mahometan
courts of his country rescued by law the people of their
own faith from slavery, they omitted no occasion to inflict it, as
a penalty, upon the African &ldquo;unbelievers&rdquo; who fell within their
jurisdiction. Among these unfortunates, the smallest crime is
considered capital, and a &ldquo;capital crime&rdquo; merits the profitable
punishment of slavery. Nor was it difficult, he told me, for a
country of &ldquo;true believers&rdquo; to acquire a multitude of bondsmen.
They detested the institution, it is true, among themselves, and
among their own caste, but it was both right and reputable
among the unorthodox. The Koran commanded the &ldquo;subjugation
of the tribes to the true faith,&rdquo; so that, to enforce the Prophet&rsquo;s
order against infidels, they resorted to the white man&rsquo;s
cupidity, which authorized its votaries to enslave the negro! My
inquisitiveness prompted me to demand whether these holy wars
spoken of in the Koran were not somewhat stimulated, in our
time, at least, by the profits that ensued; and I even ventured
to hint that it was questionable whether the mighty chief of
Footha-Yallon would willingly storm a Kaffir fortification, were
he not prompted by the booty of slaves!</p>

<p>Ahmah-de-Bellah was silent for a minute, when his solemn
face gradually relaxed into a quizzical smile, as he replied that,
in truth, Mahometans were no worse than Christians, so that it
was quite likely,&mdash;if the white elect of heaven, who knew how to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
make powder and guns, did not tempt the black man with their
weapons,&mdash;the commands of Allah would be followed with less
zeal, and implements not quite so dangerous!</p>

<p>I could not help thinking that there was a good deal of quiet
satire in the gossip of this negro prince. According to the custom
of his country, we &ldquo;exchanged names&rdquo; at parting; and,
while he put in my pocket the gift of a well-thumbed <i>Koran</i>, I
slung over his shoulder a <i>double-barrelled gun</i>. We walked side
by side for some miles into the forest, as he went forth from
Bangalang; and as we &ldquo;cracked fingers&rdquo; for farewell, I promised,
with my hand on my heart, that the &ldquo;next dry season&rdquo; I
would visit his father, the venerable Ali-Mami, in his realm of

<p>Our profits on this speculation were very flattering, both as regards
sales and acquisitions. Rice cost us one cent per pound; hides were delivered
at eighteen or twenty cents each; a bullock was sold for twenty
or thirty pounds of tobacco; sheep, goats or hogs, cost two pounds of tobacco,
or a fathom of common cotton, each; ivory was purchased at the
rate of a dollar the pound for the best, while inferior kinds were given at
half that price. In fact, the profit on our merchandise was, at least, one
hundred and fifty per cent. As gold commands the very best fabrics in
exchange, and was paid for at the rate of sixteen dollars an ounce, we
made but seventy per cent. on the article. The slaves were delivered at
the rate of one hundred &ldquo;<i>bars</i>&rdquo; each. The &ldquo;<i>bar</i>&rdquo; is valued on the coast
at half a dollar; but a pound and a half of tobacco is also a &ldquo;bar,&rdquo; as
well as a fathom of ordinary cotton cloth, or a pound of powder, while a
common musket is equal to twelve &ldquo;bars.&rdquo; Accordingly, where slaves
were purchased for one hundred and fifty pounds of tobacco, only eighteen
dollars were, in reality, paid; and when one hundred pounds of powder
were given, we got them for twenty dollars each. Our <i>British</i> muskets
cost us but three dollars apiece; yet we seldom purchased negroes for
this article alone. If the women, offered in the market, exceeded twenty-five
years of age, we made a deduction of twenty per cent.; but if they
were stanchly-built, and gave promising tokens for the future, we took
them at the price of an able-bodied man. The same estimate was made
for youths over four feet four inches high; but children were rarely purchased
at the factories, though they might be advantageously traded in
the native towns.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>I was a close watcher of Mongo John whenever he engaged in
the purchase of slaves. As each negro was brought before him,
Ormond examined the subject, without regard to sex, from head
to foot. A careful manipulation of the chief muscles, joints,
arm-pits and groins was made, to assure soundness. The mouth,
too, was inspected, and if a tooth was missing, it was noted as a
defect liable to deduction. Eyes, voice, lungs, fingers and toes
were not forgotten; so that when the negro passed from the
Mongo&rsquo;s hands without censure, he might have been readily
adopted as a good &ldquo;life&rdquo; by an insurance company.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion, to my great astonishment, I saw a stout
and apparently powerful man discarded by Ormond as utterly
worthless. His full muscles and sleek skin, to my unpractised
eye, denoted the height of robust health. Still, I was told that
he had been medicated for the market with bloating drugs, and
sweated with powder and lemon-juice to impart a gloss to his
skin. Ormond remarked that these jockey-tricks are as common
in Africa as among horse-dealers in Christian lands; and desiring
me to feel the negro&rsquo;s pulse, I immediately detected disease
or excessive excitement. In a few days I found the poor wretch,
abandoned by his owner, a paralyzed wreck in the hut of a villager
at Bangalang.</p>

<span class="caption">INSPECTION AND SALE OF A NEGRO.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
When a slave becomes useless to his master in the interior,
or exhibits signs of failing constitution, he is soon disposed of to
a peddler or broker. These men call to their aid a quack, familiar
with drugs, who, for a small compensation, undertakes to refit an
impaired body for the temptation of green-horns. Sometimes
the cheat is successfully effected; but experienced slavers detect
it readily by the yellow eye, swollen tongue, and feverish skin.</p>

<p>After a few more lessons, I was considered by the Mongo
sufficiently learned in the slave traffic to be intrusted with the
sole management of his stores. This exemption from commerce
enabled him to indulge more than ever in the use of ardent
spirits, though his vanity to be called &ldquo;king,&rdquo; still prompted
him to attend faithfully to all the &ldquo;country palavers;&rdquo;&mdash;and,
let it be said to his credit, his decisions were never defective in
judgment or impartiality.</p>

<p>After I had been three months occupied in the multifarious
intercourse of Bangalang and its neighborhood, I understood the
language well enough to dispense with the interpreter, who was
one of the Mongo&rsquo;s confidential agents. When my companion
departed on a long journey, he counselled me to make up with
Unga-golah, the <i>harem&rsquo;s</i> Cerberus, as she suspected my intimacy
with Esther, who would doubtless be denounced to Ormond,
unless I purchased the beldame&rsquo;s silence.</p>

<p>Indeed, ever since the night of warning, when the beautiful
<i>quarteroon</i> visited my hovel, I had contrived to meet this charming
girl, as the only solace of my solitude. Amid all the wild,
passionate, and savage surroundings of Bangalang, Esther&mdash;the
Pariah&mdash;was the only golden link that still seemed to bind me
to humanity and the lands beyond the seas. On that burning
coast, I was not excited by the stirring of an adventurous life,
nor was my young heart seduced and bewildered by absorbing
avarice. Many a night, when the dews penetrated my flesh, as
I looked towards the west, my soul shrank from the selfish
wretches around me, and went off in dreams to the homes I had
abandoned. When I came back to myself,&mdash;when I was forced
to recognize my doom in Africa,&mdash;when I acknowledged that my
lot had been cast, perhaps unwisely, by myself, my spirit turned,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
like the worm from the crashing heel, and found nothing that
kindled for me with the light of human sympathy, save this outcast
girl. Esther was to me as a sister, and when the hint of
her harm or loss was given, I hastened to disarm the only hand
that could inflict a blow. Unga-golah was a woman, and a rope
of sparkling coral for her neck, smothered all her wrongs.</p>

<p>The months I had passed in Africa without illness,&mdash;though
I went abroad after dark, and bathed in the river during the heat
of the day,&mdash;made me believe myself proof against malaria.
But, at length, a violent pain in my loins, accompanied by a
swimming head, warned me that the African fever held me in its
dreaded gripe. In two days I was delirious. Ormond visited
me; but I knew him not, and in my madness, called on Esther,
accompanying the name with terms of endearment. This, I was
told, stirred the surprise and jealousy of the Mongo, who forthwith
assailed the matron of his harem with a torrent of inquiries
and abuse. But Unga-golah was faithful. The beads had sealed
her tongue; so that, with the instinctive adroitness peculiar to
ladies of her color, she fabricated a story which not only quieted
the Mongo, but added lustre to Esther&rsquo;s character.</p>

<p>The credulous old man finding Unga so well disposed towards
his watchful clerk, restored the warehouse to her custody. This
was the height of her avaricious ambition; and, in token of
gratitude for my profitable malady, she contrived to let Esther
become the nurse and guardian of my sick bed.</p>

<p>As my fever and delirium continued, a native doctor, renowned
for his skill, was summoned, who ordered me to be
cupped in the African fashion by scarifying my back and stomach
with a hot knife, and applying plantain leaves to the wounds.
The operation allayed my pulse for a few hours; but as the
fever came back with new vigor, it became necessary for my
attendants to arouse the Mongo to a sense of my imminent danger.
Yet Ormond, instead of springing with alacrity to succor
a friend and retainer in affliction, sent for a young man, named
Edward Joseph, who had formerly been in his employment, but
was now settled on his own account in Bangalang.</p>

<p>Joseph proved a good Samaritan. As soon as he dared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
venture upon my removal, he took me to his establishment at Kambia,
and engaged the services of another Mandingo doctor, in
whose absurdities he believed. But all the charms and incantations
of the savage would not avail, and I remained in a state of
utter prostration and apparent insensibility until morning. As
soon as day dawned, my faithful Esther was again on the field
of action; and this time she insisted upon the trial of her judgment,
in the person of an old white-headed woman, who accompanied
her in the guise of the greatest enchantress of the coast.
A slave, paid in advance, was the fee for which she undertook to
warrant my cure.</p>

<p>No time was to be lost. The floor of a small and close mud
hut was intensely heated, and thickly strewn with moistened
lemon leaves, over which a cloth was spread for a couch. As
soon as the bed was ready, I was borne to the hovel, and, covered
with blankets, was allowed to steam and perspire, while my medical
attendant dosed me with half a tumbler of a green disgusting
juice which she extracted from herbs. This process of drinking
and barbecuing was repeated during five consecutive days,
at the end of which my fever was gone. But my convalescence
was not speedy. For many a day, I stalked about, a useless
skeleton, covering with ague, and afflicted by an insatiable appetite,
until a French physician restored me to health by the use
of cold baths at the crisis of my fever.</p>

<p>When I was sufficiently recovered to attend to business,
Mongo John desired me to resume my position in his employment.
I heard, however, from Esther, that during my illness,
Unga-golah used her opportunities so profitably in the warehouse,
that there would be sad deficiencies, which, doubtless,
might be thrown on me, if the crone were badly disposed at any
future period. Accordingly, I thought it decidedly most prudent
to decline the clerkship, and requested the Mongo to recompense
me for the time and attention I had already bestowed on him.
This was refused by the indolent voluptuary; so we parted with
coolness, and I was once more adrift in the world.</p>

<p>In these great outlying colonies and lodgments of European
nations in the East Indies and Africa, a stranger is commonly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
welcome to the hospitality of every foreigner. I had no hesitation,
therefore, in returning to the house of Joseph, who, like
myself, had been a clerk of Ormond, and suffered from the pilferings
of the matron.</p>

<p>My host, I understood, was a native of London, where he
was born of continental parents, and came to Sierra Leone with
Governor Turner. Upon the death or return of that officer,&mdash;I
do not recollect which,&mdash;the young adventurer remained in the
colony, and, for a time, enjoyed the post of harbor master. His
first visit to the Rio Pongo was in the capacity of supercargo of
a small coasting craft, laden with valuable merchandise. Joseph
succeeded in disposing of his wares, but was not equally fortunate
in collecting their avails. It was, perhaps, an ill-judged
act of the supercargo, but he declined to face his creditors with
a deficient balance-sheet; and quitting Sierra Leone for ever,
accepted service with Ormond. For a year he continued in this
employment; but, at the end of that period, considering himself
sufficiently informed of the trade and language of the river, he
sent a message to his creditors at the British settlement that he
could promptly pay them in full, if they would advance him
capital enough to commence an independent trade. The terms
were accepted by an opulent Israelite, and in a short time Edward
Joseph was numbered among the successful factors of Rio
Pongo.</p>

<p>As I had nothing to do but get well and talk, I employed my
entire leisure in acquiring the native language perfectly. The
Soosoo is a dialect of the Mandingo. Its words, ending almost
universally in vowels, render it as glibly soft and musical as
Italian; so that, in a short time, I spoke it as fluently as my
native tongue.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>The 15th of March, 1827, was an epoch in my life. I remember
it well, because it became the turning point of my
destiny. A few weeks more of indolence might have forced me
back to Europe or America, but the fortune of that day decided
my residence and dealings in Africa.</p>

<p>At dawn of the 15th, a vessel was descried in the offing, and,
as she approached the coast, the initiated soon ascertained her
to be a Spanish slaver. But, what was the amazement of the
river grandees when the captain landed and consigned his vessel
<i>to me</i>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">La Fortuna</span>,&rdquo; the property, chiefly, of my old friend the
Regla grocer, was successor of the Areostatico, which she
exceeded in size as well as comfort. Her captain was charged to
pay me my wages in full for the round voyage in the craft I had
abandoned, and handed me, besides, a purse of thirty doubloons
as a testimonial from his owners for my defence of their property
on the dreadful night of our arrival. The &ldquo;Fortuna&rdquo; was
dispatched to me for an &ldquo;assorted cargo of slaves,&rdquo; while
200,000 cigars and 500 ounces of Mexican gold, were on board
for their purchase. My commission was fixed at ten per cent.,
and I was promised a command whenever I saw fit to abandon
my residence on the African coast.</p>

<p>Having no factory, or <i>barracoon</i> of slaves, and being elevated
to the dignity of &ldquo;a trader&rdquo; in so sudden a manner, I thought
it best to summon all the factors of the river on board the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
schooner, with an offer to divide the cargo, provided they would
pledge the production of the slaves within thirty days. Dispatch
was all-important to the owners, and, so anxious was I to gratify
them, that I consented to pay fifty dollars for every slave that
should be accepted.</p>

<p>After some discussion my offer was taken, and the cargo apportioned
among the residents. They declined, however, receiving
any share of the cigars in payment, insisting on liquidation in
gold alone.</p>

<p>As this was my first enterprise, I felt at a loss to know how
to convert my useless tobacco into merchantable doubloons. In
this strait, I had recourse to the Englishman Joseph, who
hitherto traded exclusively in produce; but, being unable to
withstand the temptation of gold, had consented to furnish a
portion of my required negroes. As soon as I stated the difficulty
to Don Edward, he proposed to send the Havanas to his
Hebrew friend in Sierra Leone, where, he did not doubt, they
would be readily exchanged for Manchester merchandise. That
evening a canoe was dispatched to the English colony with the
cigars; and, on the tenth day after, the trusty Israelite appeared
in the Rio Pongo, with a cutter laden to the deck with superior
British fabrics. The rumor of five hundred doubloons disturbed
his rest in Sierra Leone! So much gold could not linger in the
hands of natives as long as Manchester and Birmingham were
represented in the colony; and, accordingly, he coasted the edge
of the surf, as rapidly as possible, to pay me a profit of four
dollars a thousand for the cigars, and to take his chances at the
exchange of my gold for the sable cargo! By this happy hit I
was enabled to pay for the required balance of negroes, as well
as to liquidate the schooners expenses while in the river. I was
amazingly rejoiced and proud at this happy result, because I
learned from the captain that the invoice of cigars was a malicious
trick, palmed off on the Areostatico&rsquo;s owners by her
captain, in order to thwart or embarrass me, when he heard I
was to be intrusted with the purchase of a cargo on the coast.</p>

<p>At the appointed day, La Fortuna sailed with 220 human
beings packed in her hold. Three months afterwards, I received
advices that she safely landed 217 in the bay of Matanzas, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
that their sale yielded a clear profit on the voyage of forty-one
thousand four hundred and thirty-eight dollars.<a name="FNanchor_B_3" id="FNanchor_B_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_3" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
As I am now fairly embarked in a trade which absorbed so
many of my most vigorous years, I suppose the reader will not
be loth to learn a little of my experience in the alleged &ldquo;cruelties&rdquo;
of this commerce; and the first question, in all likelihood,
that rises to his lips, is a solicitation to be apprised of the embarkation
and treatment of slaves on the dreaded voyage.</p>

<p>An African factor of fair repute is ever careful to select his
human cargo with consummate prudence, so as not only to supply
his employers with athletic laborers, but to avoid any taint of
disease that may affect the slaves in their transit to Cuba or the
American main. Two days before embarkation, the head of
every male and female is neatly shaved; and, if the cargo belongs
to several owners, each man&rsquo;s <i>brand</i> is impressed on the
body of his respective negro. This operation is performed with
pieces of silver wire, or small irons fashioned into the merchant&rsquo;s
initials, heated just hot enough to blister without burning the
skin. When the entire cargo is the venture of but one proprietor,
the branding is always dispensed with.</p>

<p>On the appointed day, the <i>barracoon</i> or slave-pen is made
joyous by the abundant &ldquo;feed&rdquo; which signalizes the negro&rsquo;s
last hours in his native country. The feast over, they are taken
alongside the vessel in canoes; and as they touch the deck, they
are entirely stripped, so that women as well as men go out of
Africa as they came into it&mdash;<i>naked</i>. This precaution, it will be
understood, is indispensable; for perfect nudity, during the whole
voyage, is the only means of securing cleanliness and health. In
this state, they are immediately ordered below, the men to the
hold and the women to the cabin, while boys and girls are, day
and night, kept on deck, where their sole protection from the
elements is a sail in fair weather, and a <i>tarpaulin</i> in foul.</p>

<p>At meal time they are distributed in messes of ten. Thirty
years ago, when the Spanish slave-trade was lawful, the captains
were somewhat more ceremoniously religious than at present, and
it was then a universal habit to make the gangs say grace before
meat, and give thanks afterwards. In our days, however, they
dispense with this ritual, and content themselves with a &ldquo;<i>Viva
la Habana</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;hurrah for Havana,&rdquo; accompanied by a clapping
of hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
This over, a bucket of salt water is served to each mess, by
way of &ldquo;finger glasses&rdquo; for the ablution of hands, after which a
<i>kidd</i>,&mdash;either of rice, farina, yams, or beans,&mdash;according to the
tribal habit of the negroes, is placed before the squad. In order
to prevent greediness or inequality in the appropriation of
nourishment, the process is performed by signals from a monitor,
whose motions indicate when the darkies shall dip and when
they shall swallow.</p>

<p>It is the duty of a guard to report immediately whenever a
slave refuses to eat, in order that his abstinence may be traced
to stubbornness or disease. Negroes have sometimes been found
in slavers who attempted voluntary starvation; so that, when the
watch reports the patient to be &ldquo;shamming,&rdquo; his appetite is
stimulated by the medical antidote of a &ldquo;cat.&rdquo; If the slave,
however, is truly ill, he is forthwith ticketed for the sick list by
a bead or button around his neck, and dispatched to an infirmary
in the forecastle.</p>

<p>These meals occur twice daily,&mdash;at ten in the morning and
four in the afternoon,&mdash;and are terminated by another ablution.
Thrice in each twenty-four hours they are served with half a pint
of water. Pipes and tobacco are circulated economically among
both sexes; but, as each negro cannot be allowed the luxury of a
separate bowl, boys are sent round with an adequate supply,
allowing a few whiffs to each individual. On regular days,&mdash;probably
three times a week,&mdash;their mouths are carefully rinsed
with vinegar, while, nearly every morning, a dram is given as an
antidote to scurvy.</p>

<p>Although it is found necessary to keep the sexes apart, they
are allowed to converse freely during day while on deck. Corporal
punishment is <i>never</i> inflicted save by order of an officer,
and, even then, not until the culprit understands exactly why it
is done. Once a week, the ship&rsquo;s barber scrapes their chins
without assistance from soap; and, on the same day, their nails
are closely pared, to insure security from harm in those nightly
battles that occur, when the slave contests with his neighbor
every inch of plank to which he is glued. During afternoons of
serene weather, men, women, girls, and boys are allowed to unite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span>
in African melodies, which they always enhance by an extemporaneous
<i>tom-tom</i> on the bottom of a tub or tin kettle.</p>

<p>These hints will apprise the reader that the greatest care,
compatible with safety, is taken of a negro&rsquo;s health and cleanliness
on the voyage. In every well-conducted slaver, the captain,
officers, and crew, are alert and vigilant to preserve the cargo.
It is their personal interest, as well as the interest of humanity
to do so. The boatswain is incessant in his patrol of purification,
and disinfecting substances are plenteously distributed.
The upper deck is washed and swabbed daily; the slave deck is
scraped and holy-stoned; and, at nine o&rsquo;clock each morning, the
captain inspects every part of his craft; so that no vessel, except
a man-of-war, can compare with a slaver in systematic order,
purity, and neatness. I am not aware that the ship-fever, which
sometimes decimates the emigrants from Europe, has ever prevailed
in these African traders.</p>

<p>At sundown, the process of stowing the slaves for the night
is begun. The second mate and boatswain descend into the
hold, whip in hand, and range the slaves in their regular places;
those on the right side of the vessel facing forward, and lying
in each other&rsquo;s lap, while those on the left are similarly stowed
with their faces towards the stern. In this way each negro lies
on his right side, which is considered preferable for the action of
the heart. In allotting places, particular attention is paid to
size, the taller being selected for the greatest breadth of the
vessel, while the shorter and younger are lodged near the bows.
When the cargo is large and the lower deck crammed, the supernumeraries
are disposed of on deck, which is securely covered
with boards to shield them from moisture. The <i>strict</i> discipline
of nightly stowage is, of course, of the greatest importance in
slavers, else every negro would accommodate himself as if he
were a passenger.</p>

<p>In order to insure perfect silence and regularity during night,
a slave is chosen as constable from every ten, and furnished with
a &ldquo;cat&rdquo; to enforce commands during his appointed watch. In
remuneration for his services, which, it may be believed, are
admirably performed whenever the whip is required, he is adorned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
with an old shirt or tarry trowsers. Now and then, billets of
wood are distributed among the sleepers, but this luxury is never
granted until the good temper of the negroes is ascertained, for
slaves have often been tempted to mutiny by the power of arming
themselves with these pillows from the forest.</p>

<p>It is very probable that many of my readers will consider it
barbarous to make slaves lie down naked upon a board, but let
me inform them that native Africans are not familiar with the
use of feather-beds, nor do any but the free and rich in their
mother country indulge in the luxury even of a mat or raw-hide.
Among the Mandingo chiefs,&mdash;the most industrious and civilized
of Africans,&mdash;the beds, divans, and sofas, are heaps of mud,
covered with untanned skins for cushions, while logs of wood
serve for bolsters! I am of opinion, therefore, that emigrant
slaves experience very slight inconvenience in lying down on the
deck.</p>

<p>But <i>ventilation</i> is carefully attended to. The hatches and
bulkheads of every slaver are grated, and apertures are cut
about the deck for ampler circulation of air. Wind-sails, too, are
constantly pouring a steady draft into the hold, except during a
chase, when, of course, every comfort is temporarily sacrificed
for safety. During calms or in light and baffling winds, when the
suffocating air of the tropics makes ventilation impossible, the
gratings are always removed, and portions of the slaves allowed
to repose at night on deck, while the crew is armed to watch the
sleepers.</p>

<p>Handcuffs are rarely used on shipboard. It is the common
custom to secure slaves in the <i>barracoons</i>, and while shipping,
by chaining <i>ten</i> in a gang; but as these platoons would be extremely
inconvenient at sea, the manacles are immediately taken
off and replaced by leg-irons, which fasten them in pairs by the
feet. Shackles are never used but for <i>full-grown men</i>, while
<i>women</i> and <i>boys</i> are set at liberty as soon as they embark. It
frequently happens that when the behavior of <i>male</i> slaves warrants
their freedom, they are released from all fastenings long
before they arrive. Irons are altogether dispensed with on many
<i>Brazilian</i> slavers, as negroes from Anjuda, Benin, and Angola,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
are mild; and unaddicted to revolt like those who dwell east of
the Cape or north of the Gold Coast. Indeed, a knowing trader
will never use chains but when compelled, for the longer a slave
is ironed the more he deteriorates; and, as his sole object is to
land a healthy cargo, pecuniary interest, as well as natural feeling,
urges the sparing of metal.</p>

<p>My object in writing this palliative description is not to exculpate
the slavers or their commerce, but to correct those exaggerated
stories which have so long been current in regard to the
<i>usual</i> voyage of a trader. I have always believed that the cause
of humanity, as well as any other cause, was least served by
over-statement; and I am sure that if the narratives given by
Englishmen are true, the voyages they detail must either have
occurred before my day, or were conducted in British vessels,
while her majesty&rsquo;s subjects still considered the traffic lawful.<a name="FNanchor_C_4" id="FNanchor_C_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_4" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_4" id="Footnote_C_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_4"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> The treaty with Spain, which was designed by Great Britain to end
the slave-trade, failed utterly to produce the desired result.</p>

<p>All <i>profitable</i> trade,&mdash;illicit, contraband, or what not,&mdash;<i>will</i> be carried
on by avaricious men, as long as the temptation continues. Accordingly,
whenever a trade becomes <i>forced</i>, the only and sure result of violent
restriction is to imperil still more both life and cargo.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;The treaty with Spain, it is said, was enforced some time before
it was properly promulgated or notified; so that British cruisers seized
over eighty vessels, one third of which certainly were not designed for
slave-trade.</p>

<p>2d.&mdash;As the compact condemned slave vessels to be broken up, the
sailing qualities of craft were improved to facilitate escape, rather than
insure human comfort.</p>

<p>3d.&mdash;The Spanish slavers had recourse to Brazilians and Portuguese to
cover their property; and, as slavers could not be fitted out in Cuba, other
nations sent their vessels ready equipped to Africa, and (under the jib-booms
of cruisers) Sardinians, Frenchmen and Americans, transferred them
to slave traders, while the captains and parts of the crew took passage home
in regular merchantmen.</p>

<p>4th.&mdash;As the treaty created greater risk, every method of economy was
resorted to; and the crowding and cramming of slaves was one of the
most prominent results. Water and provisions were diminished; and
every thing was sacrificed for gain.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>In old times, before treaties made slave-trade piracy, the landing
of human cargoes was as comfortably conducted as the disembarkation
of flour. But now, the enterprise is effected with
secrecy and hazard. A wild, uninhabited portion of the coast,
where some little bay or sheltering nook exists, is commonly
selected by the captain and his confederates. As soon as the
vessel is driven close to the beach and anchored, her boats are
packed with slaves, while the craft is quickly dismantled to avoid
detection from sea or land. The busy skiffs are hurried to and
fro incessantly till the cargo is entirely ashore, when the secured
gang, led by the captain, and escorted by armed sailors, is rapidly
marched to the nearest plantation. There it is safe from the
rapacity of local magistrates, who, if they have a chance, imitate
their superiors by exacting &ldquo;<i>gratifications</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the mean time, a <i>courier</i> has been dispatched to the
owners in Havana, Matanzas, or Santiago de Cuba, who immediately
post to the plantation with clothes for the slaves and gold
for the crew. Preparations are quickly made through brokers
for the sale of the blacks; while the vessel, if small, is disguised,
to warrant her return under the coasting flag to a port of clearance.
If the craft happens to be large, it is considered perilous
to attempt a return with a cargo, or &ldquo;<i>in distress</i>,&rdquo; and, accordingly,
she is either sunk or burnt where she lies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
When the genuine African reaches a plantation for the first
time, he fancies himself in paradise. He is amazed by the
generosity with which he is fed with fruit and fresh provisions.
His new clothes, red cap, and roasting blanket (a civilized
superfluity he never dreamed of), strike him dumb with delight,
and, in his savage joy, he not only forgets country, relations,
and friends, but skips about like a monkey, while he dons his
garments wrongside out or hind-part before! The arrival of a
carriage or cart creates no little confusion among the Ethiopian
groups, who never imagined that beasts could be made to work.
But the climax of wonder is reached when that paragon of oddities,
a Cuban <i>postilion</i>, dressed in his sky-blue coat, silver-laced
hat, white breeches, polished jack-boots, and ringing spurs,
leaps from his prancing quadruped, and bids them welcome in
their mother-tongue. Every African rushes to &ldquo;snap fingers&rdquo;
with his equestrian brother, who, according to orders, forthwith
preaches an edifying sermon on the happiness of being a white
man&rsquo;s slave, taking care to jingle his spurs and crack his whip
at the end of every sentence, by way of <i>amen</i>.</p>

<p>Whenever a cargo is owned by several proprietors, each one
takes his share at once to his plantation; but if it is the property
of speculators, the blacks are sold to any one who requires
them before removal from the original depot. The sale is, of
course, conducted as rapidly as possible, to forestall the interference
of British officials with the Captain-General.</p>

<p>Many of the Spanish Governors in Cuba have respected
treaties, or, at least, promised to enforce the laws. Squadrons
of dragoons and troops of lancers have been paraded with convenient
delay, and ordered to gallop to plantations designated
by the representative of England. It generally happens, however,
that when the hunters arrive the game is gone. Scandal
declares that, while brokers are selling the blacks at the depot,
it is not unusual for their owner or his agent to be found
knocking at the door of the Captain-General&rsquo;s secretary. It is
often said that the Captain-General himself is sometimes present
in the sanctuary, and, after a familiar chat about the happy
landing of &ldquo;the contraband,&rdquo;&mdash;as the traffic is amiably called,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
the requisite <i>rouleaux</i> are insinuated into the official desk under
the intense smoke of a fragrant <i>cigarillo</i>. The metal is always
considered the property of the Captain-General, but his scribe
avails himself of a lingering farewell at the door, to hint an
immediate and pressing need for &ldquo;a very small darkey!&rdquo; Next
day, the diminutive African does not appear; but, as it is believed
that Spanish officials prefer gold even to mortal flesh, his
algebraic equivalent is unquestionably furnished in the shape of
shining ounces!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>The prompt dispatch I gave the schooner Fortuna, started
new ideas among the traders of the Rio Pongo, so that it was
generally agreed my method of dividing the cargo among different
factors was not only most advantageous for speed, but prevented
monopoly, and gave all an equal chance. At a &ldquo;grand
palaver&rdquo; or assemblage of the traders on the river, it was resolved
that this should be the course of trade for the future.
All the factors, except Ormond, attended and assented; but
we learned that the Mongo&rsquo;s people, with difficulty prevented
him from sending an armed party to break up our deliberations.</p>

<p>The knowledge of this hostile feeling soon spread throughout
the settlement and adjacent towns, creating considerable excitement
against Ormond. My plan and principles were approved
by the natives as well as foreigners, so that warning was sent
the Mongo, if any harm befell Joseph and Theodore, it would
be promptly resented. Our native landlord, Ali-Ninpha, a
Foulah by descent, told him boldly, in presence of his people,
that the Africans were &ldquo;tired of a mulatto Mongo;&rdquo; and, from
that day, his power dwindled away visibly, though a show of
respect was kept up in consequence of his age and ancient importance.</p>

<p>During these troubles, the Areostatico returned to my consignment,
and in twenty-two days was dispatched with a choice
cargo of Mandingoes,&mdash;a tribe, which had become fashionable for
house servants among the Havanese. But the luckless vessel
was never heard of, and it is likely she went down in some of
the dreadful gales that scourged the coast immediately after her
departure.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>I had now grown to such sudden importance among the natives,
that the neighboring chiefs and kings sent me daily messages
of friendship, with trifling gifts that I readily accepted. One
of these bordering lords, more generous and insinuating than
the rest, hinted several times his anxiety for a closer connection
in affection as well as trade, and, at length, insisted upon becoming
my father-in-law!</p>

<p>I had always heard in Italy that it was something to receive
the hand of a princess, even after long and tedious wooing; but
now that I was surrounded by a mob of kings, who absolutely
thrust their daughters on me, I confess I had the bad taste not
to leap with joy at the royal offering. Still, I was in a difficult
position, as no graver offence can be given a chief than to reject
his child. It is so serious an insult to refuse a wife, that, high
born natives, in order to avoid quarrels or war, accept the tender
boon, and as soon as etiquette permits, pass it over to a friend or
relation. As the offer was made to me personally by the king, I
found the utmost difficulty in escaping. Indeed, he would receive
no excuse. When I declined on account of the damsel&rsquo;s
youth, he laughed incredulously. If I urged the feebleness of
my health and tardy convalescence, he insisted that a regular life
of matrimony was the best cordial for an impaired constitution.
In fact, the paternal solicitude of his majesty for my doubloons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
was so urgent that I was on the point of yielding myself a
patient sacrifice, when Joseph came to my relief with the offer
of his hand as a substitute.</p>

<p>The Gordian knot was cut. Prince Yungee in reality did not
care so much who should be his son-in-law as that he obtained
one with a white skin and plentiful purse. Joseph or Theodore,
Saxon or Italian, made no difference to the chief; and, as is the
case in all Oriental lands, the opinion of the lady was of no importance
whatever.</p>

<p>I cannot say that my partner viewed this matrimonial project
with the disgust that I did. Perhaps he was a man of
more liberal philosophy and wider views of human brotherhood;
at any rate, his residence in Africa gave him a taste not only for
its people, habits, and superstitions, but he upheld practical
amalgamation with more fervor and honesty than a regular
abolitionist. Joseph was possessed by Africo-mania. He admired
the women, the men, the language, the cookery, the music.
He would fall into philharmonic ecstasies over the discord of a
bamboo <i>tom-tom</i>. I have reason to believe that even African
barbarities had charms for the odd Englishman; but he was
chiefly won by the <i>dolce far niente</i> of the natives, and the Oriental
license of polygamy. In a word, Joseph had the same taste for a
full-blooded <i>cuffee</i>, that an epicure has for the <i>haut gout</i> of a
stale partridge, and was in ecstasies at my extrication. He neglected
his <i>siestas</i> and his accounts; he wandered from house to
house with the rapture of an impatient bridegroom; and, till
every thing was ready for the nuptial rites, no one at the factory
had a moment&rsquo;s rest.</p>

<p>As the bride&rsquo;s relations were eminent folks on the upper part
of the river, they insisted that the marriage ceremony should be
performed with all the honorable formalities due to the lady&rsquo;s
rank. Esther, who acted as my mentor in every &ldquo;country-question,&rdquo;
suggested that it would be contrary to the Englishman&rsquo;s
interest to ally himself with a family whose only motive was sordid.
She strongly urged that if he persisted in taking the girl,
he should do so without a &ldquo;<i>colungee</i>&rdquo; or ceremonial feast. But
Joseph was obstinate as a bull; and as he doubted whether he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
would ever commit matrimony again, he insisted that the nuptials
should be celebrated with all the fashionable splendor of
high life in Africa.</p>

<p>When this was decided, it became necessary, by a fiction
of etiquette, to ignore the previous offer of the bride, and to
begin anew, as if the damsel were to be sought in the most delicate
way by a desponding lover. She must be demanded formally,
by the bridegroom from her reluctant mother; and accordingly,
the most respectable matron in our colony was chosen by
Joseph from his colored acquaintances to be the bearer of his
valentine. In the present instance, the selected Cupid was the
principal wife of our native landlord, Ali-Ninpha; and, as Africans
as well as Turks love by the pound, the dame happened to
be one of the fattest, as well as most respectable, in our parish.
Several female <i>attach&eacute;s</i> were added to the suite of the ambassadress,
who forthwith departed to make a proper &ldquo;<i>dantica</i>.&rdquo;
The gifts selected were of four kinds. First of all, two demijohns
of <i>trade</i>-rum were filled to gladden the community of Mongo-Yungee&rsquo;s
town. Next, a piece of blue cotton cloth, a musket,
a keg of powder, and a demijohn of <i>pure</i> rum, were packed for
papa. Thirdly, a youthful virgin dressed in a white &ldquo;tontongee,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2_5" id="FNanchor_2_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_5" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
a piece of white cotton cloth, a white basin, a white sheep,
and a basket of white rice, were put up for mamma, in token of her
daughter&rsquo;s purity. And, lastly, a German looking-glass, several
bunches of beads, a coral necklace, a dozen of turkey-red handkerchiefs,
and a spotless white country-cloth, were presented to
the bride; together with a decanter of white palm-oil for the
anointment of her ebony limbs after the bath, which is never neglected
by African <i>belles</i>.</p>

<p>While the missionary of love was absent, our sighing swain
devoted his energies to the erection of a bridal palace; and the
task required just as many days as were employed in the creation
of the world. The building was finished by the aid of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
bamboos, straw, and a modicum of mud; and, as Joseph imagined
that love and coolness were secured in such a climate by
utter darkness, he provided an abundance of that commodity by
omitting windows entirely. The furnishing of the domicil was
completed with all the luxury of native taste. An elastic four-poster
was constructed of bamboos; some dashing crockery was
set about the apartment for display; a cotton quilt was cast over
the matted couch; an old trunk served for bureau and wardrobe;
and, as negresses adore looking-glasses, the largest in our
warehouse was nailed against the door, as the only illuminated
part of the edifice.</p>

<p>At last all was complete, and Joseph snapped his fingers with
delight, when the corpulent dame waddled up asthmatically, and
announced with a wheeze that her mission was prosperous. If
there had ever been doubt, there was now no more. The oracular
&ldquo;<i>fetiche</i>&rdquo; had announced that the delivery of the bride to
her lord might take place &ldquo;on the tenth day of the new
moon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the planet waxed from its slender sickle to the thicker
quarter, the impatience of my Cockney waxed with it; but, at
length, the firing of muskets, the twang of horns, and the rattle
of tom-toms, gave notice from the river that <span class="smcap">Coomba</span>, the bride,
was approaching the quay. Joseph and myself hastily donned
our clean shirts, white trousers, and glistening pumps; and, under
the shade of broad <i>sombreros</i> and umbrellas, proceeded to greet
the damsel. Our fat friend, the matron; Ali-Ninpha, her husband;
our servants, and a troop of village ragamuffins, accompanied
us to the water&rsquo;s brink, so that we were just in time to
receive the five large canoes bearing the escort of the king and
his daughter. Boat after boat disgorged its passengers; but, to
our dismay, they ranged themselves apart, and were evidently
displeased. When the last canoe, decorated with flags, containing
the bridal party, approached the strand, the chief of the escort
signalled it to stop and forbade the landing.</p>

<p>In a moment there was a general row&mdash;a row, conceivable
only by residents of Africa, or those whose ears have been regaled
with the chattering of a &ldquo;wilderness of monkeys.&rdquo; Our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
lusty <i>factotum</i> was astonished. The Cockney aspirated his <i>h&rsquo;s</i>
with uncommon volubility. We hastened from one to the other
to inquire the cause; nor was it until near half an hour had
been wasted in palaver, that I found they considered themselves
slighted, first of all because we had not fired a salvo in their
honor, and secondly because we failed to spread mats from the
beach to the house, upon which the bride might place her virgin
feet without defilement! These were indispensable formalities
among the &ldquo;upper ten;&rdquo; and the result was that <span class="smcap">Coomba</span> could
not land unless the etiquette were fulfilled.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a sad dilemma. The guns could be fired instantly;&mdash;but
where, alas! at a moment&rsquo;s notice, were we to
obtain mats enough to carpet the five hundred yards of transit
from the river to the house? The match must be broken off!</p>

<p>My crest-fallen cockney immediately began to exculpate himself
by pleading ignorance of the country&rsquo;s customs,&mdash;assuring
the strangers that he had not the slightest inkling of the requirement.
Still, the stubborn &ldquo;master of ceremonies&rdquo; would not
relax an iota of his rigorous behests.</p>

<p>At length, our bulky dame approached the master of the
bridal party, and, squatting on her knees, confessed her neglectful
fault. Then, for the first time, I saw a gleam of hope.
Joseph improved the moment by alleging that he employed this
lady patroness to conduct every thing in the sublimest style imaginable,
because it was presumed no one knew better than she
all that was requisite for so admirable and virtuous a lady as
<span class="smcap">Coomba</span>. Inasmuch, however, as he had been disappointed by
her unhappy error, he did not think the blow should fall on <i>his</i>
shoulders. The negligent matron ought to pay the penalty; and,
as it was impossible now to procure the mats, she should forfeit
the value of a slave to aid the merry-making, <i>and carry the
bride on her back from the river to her home</i>!</p>

<p>A clapping of hands and a quick murmur of assent ran through
the crowd, telling me that the compromise was accepted. But
the porterage was no sinecure for the delinquent elephant, who
found it difficult at times to get along over African sands even
without a burden. Still, no time was lost in further parley or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
remonstrance. The muskets and cannon were brought down and
exploded; the royal boat was brought to the landing; father,
mother, brothers, and relations were paraded on the strand; tom-toms
and horns were beaten and blown; and, at last, the suffering
missionary waddled to the canoe to receive the veiled form
of the slender bride.</p>

<p>The process of removal was accompanied by much merriment.
Our corpulent porter groaned as she &ldquo;larded the lean earth&rdquo;
beneath her ponderous tread; but, in due course of labor
and patience, she sank with her charge on the bamboo couch of
Master Joseph.</p>

<p>As soon as the bearer and the burden were relieved from
their fatigue, the maiden was brought to the door, and, as her
long concealing veil of spotless cotton was unwrapped from head
and limbs, a shout of admiration went up from the native crowd
that followed us from the quay to the hovel. As Joseph received
the hand of <span class="smcap">Coomba</span>, he paid the princely fee of a slave to
the matron.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coomba</span> had certainly not numbered more than sixteen years,
yet, in that burning region, the sex ripen long before their pallid
sisters of the North. She belonged to the Soosoo tribe, but was
descended from Mandingo ancestors, and I was particularly struck
by the uncommon symmetry of her tapering limbs. Her features
and head, though decidedly African, were not of that coarse
and heavy cast that marks the lineaments of her race. The
grain of her shining skin was as fine and polished as ebony. A
melancholy languor subdued and deepened the blackness of her
large eyes, while her small and even teeth gleamed with the brilliant
purity of snow. Her mouth was rosy and even delicate;
and, indeed, had not her ankles, feet, and wool, manifested the
unfortunate types of her kindred, <span class="smcap">Coomba</span>, the daughter of
Mongo-Yungee, might have passed for a <i>chef d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre in black
marble</i>.</p>

<p>The scant dress of the damsel enabled me to be so minute in
this catalogue of her charms; and, in truth, had I not inspected
them closely, I would have violated matrimonial etiquette as
much as if I failed to admire the <i>trousseau</i> and gifts of a bride
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
at home. Coomba&rsquo;s costume was as innocently primitive as
Eve&rsquo;s after the expulsion. Like all maidens of her country, she
had beads round her ankles, beads round her waist, beads round
her neck, while an abundance of bracelets hooped her arms from
wrist to elbow. The white <i>tontongee</i> still girdled her loins;
but Coomba&rsquo;s climate was her mantuamaker, and indicated more
necessity for ornament than drapery. Accordingly, Coomba was
obedient to Nature, and troubled herself very little about a supply
of useless garments, to load the presses and vex the purse of
her bridegroom.</p>

<p>As soon as the process of unveiling was over, and time had
been allowed the spectators to behold the damsel, her mother led
her gently to the fat ambassadress, who, with her companions,
bore the girl to a bath for ablution, anointment, and perfuming.
While Coomba underwent this ceremony at the hands
of our matron, flocks of sable dames entered the apartment;
and, as they withdrew, shook hands with her mother, in token
of the maiden&rsquo;s purity, and with the groom in compliment to his
luck.</p>

<p>As soon as the bath and <i>oiling</i> were over, six girls issued
from the hut, bearing the glistening bride on a snow-white sheet
to the home of her spouse. The transfer was soon completed,
and the burden deposited on the nuptial bed. The dwelling was
then closed and put in charge of sentinels; when the plump
plenipotentiary approached the Anglo-Saxon, and handing him
the scant fragments of the bridal dress, pointed to the door, and,
in a loud voice, exclaimed: &ldquo;White man, this authorizes you to
take possession of your wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may naturally be supposed that our radiant cockney was
somewhat embarrassed by so public a display of matrimonial
happiness, at six o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, on the thirtieth day of
a sweltering June. Joseph could not help looking at me with a
blush and a laugh, as he saw the eyes of the whole crowd fixed
on his movements; but, nerving himself like a man, he made a
profound <i>salaam</i> to the admiring multitude, and shaking my
hand with a convulsive grip, plunged into the darkness of his
abode. A long pole was forthwith planted before the door, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
a slender strip of white cotton, about the size of a &ldquo;<i>tontongee</i>,&rdquo;
was hoisted in token of privacy, and floated from the staff like a
pennant, giving notice that the commodore is aboard.</p>

<p>No sooner were these rites over, than the house was surrounded
by a swarm of women from the adjacent villages, whose
incessant songs, screams, chatter, and <i>tom-tom</i> beatings, drowned
every mortal sound. Meanwhile, the men of the party&mdash;whose
merriment around an enormous <i>bonfire</i> was augmented by abundance
of liquor and provisions&mdash;amused themselves in dancing,
shouting, yelling, and discharging muskets in honor of the nuptials.</p>

<p>Such was the ceaseless serenade that drove peace from the
lovers&rsquo; pillow during the whole of that memorable night. At
dawn, the corpulent matron again appeared from among the
wild and reeling crowd, and concluding her functions by some
mysterious ceremonies, led forth the lank groom from the dark
cavity of his hot and sleepless oven, looking more like a bewildered
wretch rescued from drowning, than a radiant lover fresh
from his charmer. In due time, the bride also was brought forth
by the matrons for the bath, where she was anointed from head
to foot with a vegetable butter,&mdash;whose odor is probably more
agreeable to Africans than Americans,&mdash;and fed with a bowl of
broth made from a young and tender pullet.</p>

<p>The marriage <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> lasted three days, after which I insisted
that Joseph should give up nonsense for business, and sobered
his ecstasies by handing him a wedding-bill for five hundred and
fifty dollars.</p>

<p>There is hardly a doubt that he considered <span class="smcap">Coomba</span> very
<i>dear</i>, if not absolutely adorable!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>I am sorry to say that my colleague&rsquo;s honeymoon did not last
long, although it was not interrupted by domestic discord. One
of his malicious Sierra Leone creditors, who had not been dealt
with quite as liberally as the rest, called on the colonial governor
of that British establishment, and alleged that a certain
Edward Joseph, an Englishman, owned a factory on the Rio
Pongo, in company with a Spaniard, and was engaged in the
slave-trade!</p>

<p>At this the British lion, of course, growled in his African
cage, and bestirred himself to punish the recreant cub. An expedition
was forthwith fitted out to descend upon our little establishment;
and, in all likelihood, the design would have been
executed, had not our friendly Israelite in Sierra Leone sent us
timely warning. No sooner did the news arrive than Joseph
embarked in a slaver, and, packing up his valuables, together
with sixty negroes, fled from Africa. His disconsolate bride
was left to return to her parents.</p>

<p>As the hostile visit from the British colony was hourly expected,
I did not tarry long in putting a new face on Kambia.
Fresh books were made out in my name exclusively; their dates
were carefully suited to meet all inquiries; and the townspeople
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
were prepared to answer impertinent questions; so that, when
Lieutenant Findlay, of Her Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s naval service,
made his appearance in the river, with three boats bearing the
cross of St. George, no man in the settlement was less anxious
than Don T&eacute;odore, the <i>Spaniard</i>.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant handed me an order from the governor
of Sierra Leone and its dependencies, authorizing him to burn or
destroy the property of Joseph, as well as to arrest that personage
himself, I regretted that I was unable to facilitate his patriotic
projects, inasmuch as the felon was afloat on salt water, while
all his property had long before been conveyed to me by a regular
bill of sale. In proof of my assertions, I produced the instrument
and the books; and when I brought in our African
landlord to sustain me in every particular, the worthy lieutenant
was forced to relinquish his hostility and accept an invitation to
dinner. His conduct during the whole investigation was that of
a gentleman; which, I am sorry to say, was not always the case
with his professional countrymen.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>During the rainy season, which begins in June and lasts till
October, the stores of provisions in establishments along the
Atlantic coast often become sadly impaired. The Foulah and
Mandingo tribes of the interior are prevented by the swollen
condition of intervening streams from visiting the beach with
their produce. In these straits, the factories have recourse by
canoes to the smaller rivers, which are neither entered by sea-going
vessels, nor blockaded for the caravans of interior chiefs.</p>

<p>Among the tribes or clans visited by me in such seasons, I
do not remember any whose intercourse afforded more pleasure,
or exhibited nobler traits, than the <span class="smcap">Bagers</span>, who dwell on the
solitary margins of these shallow rivulets, and subsist by boiling
salt in the dry season and making palm-oil in the wet. I have
never read an account of these worthy blacks, whose civility,
kindness, and honesty will compare favorably with those of more
civilized people.</p>

<p>The Bagers live very much apart from the great African
tribes, and keep up their race by intermarriage. The language
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
is peculiar, and altogether devoid of that Italian softness that
makes the Soosoo so musical.</p>

<p>Having a week or two of perfect leisure, I determined to
set out in a canoe to visit one of these establishments, especially
as no intelligence had reached me for some time from one of my
country traders who had been dispatched thither with an invoice
of goods to purchase palm-oil. My canoe was comfortably fitted
with a waterproof awning, and provisioned for a week.</p>

<p>A tedious pull along the coast and through the dangerous
surf, brought us to the narrow creek through whose marshy
mesh of <i>mangroves</i> we squeezed our canoe to the bank. Even
after landing, we waded a considerable distance through marsh
before we reached the solid land. The Bager town stood some
hundred yards from the landing, at the end of a desolate savanna,
whose lonely waste spread as far as the eye could reach. The
village itself seemed quite deserted, so that I had difficulty in
finding &ldquo;the oldest inhabitant,&rdquo; who invariably stays at home
and acts the part of chieftain. This venerable personage welcomed
me with great cordiality; and, having made my <i>dantica</i>,
or, in other words, declared the purpose of my visit, I desired to
be shown the trader&rsquo;s house. The patriarch led me at once to a
hut, whose miserable thatch was supported by four posts. Here
I recognized a large chest, a rum cask, and the grass hammock
of my agent. I was rather exasperated to find my property thus
neglected and exposed, and began venting my wrath in no seemly
terms on the delinquent clerk, when my conductor laid his hand
gently on my sleeve, and said there was no need to blame him.
&ldquo;This,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;is his house; here your property is sheltered
from sun and rain; and, among the Bagers, whenever your
goods are protected from the elements, they are safe from every
danger. Your man has gone across the plain to a neighboring
town for oil; to-night he will be back;&mdash;in the mean time, look
at your goods!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I opened the chest, which, to my surprise, was unlocked,
and found it nearly full of the merchandise I had placed in it.
I shook the cask, and its weight seemed hardly diminished. I
turned the spigot, and lo! the rum trickled on my feet.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
Hard-by was a temporary shed, filled to the roof with hides and
casks of palm-oil, all of which, the gray-beard declared was my
property.</p>

<p>Whilst making this inspection, I have no doubt the expression
of my face indicated a good deal of wonder, for I saw the
old man smile complacently as he followed me with his quiet
eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;it is all there,&mdash;is it not? We
Bagers are neither Soosoos, Mandingoes, Foulahs, nor <i>White-men</i>,
that the goods of a stranger are not safe in our towns!
We work for a living; we want little; big ships never come to
us, and we neither steal from our guests nor go to war to sell one
another!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The conversation, I thought, was becoming a little personal;
and, with a gesture of impatience, I put a stop to it. On second
thoughts, however, I turned abruptly round, and shaking the
noble savage&rsquo;s hand with a vigor that made him wince, presented
him with a piece of cloth. Had Diogenes visited Africa in
search of his man, it is by no means unlikely that he might have
extinguished his lamp among the Bagers!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>It was about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when I arrived in
the town, which, as I before observed, seemed quite deserted,
except by a dozen or two ebony antiquities, who crawled into
the sunshine when they learned the advent of a stranger. The
young people were absent gathering palm nuts in a neighboring
grove. A couple of hours before sundown, my trader returned;
and, shortly after, the merry gang of villagers made
their appearance, laughing, singing, dancing, and laden with
fruit. As soon as the gossips announced the arrival of a white
man during their absence, the little hut that had been hospitably
assigned me was surrounded by a crowd, five or six deep, of men,
women, and children. The pressure was so close and sudden
that I was almost stifled. Finding they would not depart until
I made myself visible, I emerged from concealment and shook
hands with nearly all. The women, in particular, insisted on
gratifying themselves with a <i>sumboo</i> or smell at my face,&mdash;which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
is the native&rsquo;s kiss,&mdash;and folded their long black arms in an
embrace of my neck, threatening peril to my shirt with their
oiled and dusty flesh. However, I noticed so much <i>bonhommie</i>
among the happy crew that my heart would not allow
me to repulse them; so I kissed the youngest and shunned the
crones. In token of my good will, I led a dozen or more of
the prettiest to the rum-barrel, and made them happy for the
night.</p>

<p>When the townsfolks had comfortably nestled themselves in
their hovels, the old chief, with a show of some formality, presented
me a heavy ram-goat, distinguished for its formidable
head-ornaments, which, he said, was offered as a <i>bonne-bouche</i>, for
my supper. He then sent a crier through the town, informing
the women that a white stranger would be their guest during
the night; and, in less than half an hour, my hut was visited
by most of the village dames and damsels. One brought a pint
of rice; another some roots of <i>cassava</i>; another, a few spoonfuls
of palm-oil; another a bunch of peppers; while the oldest
lady of the party made herself particularly remarkable by the
gift of a splendid fowl. In fact, the crier had hardly gone his
rounds, before my mat was filled with the voluntary contributions
of the villagers; and the wants, not only of myself but of my
eight rowers, completely supplied.</p>

<p>There was nothing peculiar in this exhibition of hospitality,
on account of my nationality. It was the mere fulfilment of a
Bager law; and the poorest <i>black stranger</i> would have shared
the rite as well as myself. I could not help thinking that I
might have travelled from one end of England or America to the
other, without meeting a Bager <i>welcome</i>. Indeed, it seemed
somewhat questionable, whether it were better for the English to
civilize Africa, or for the Bagers to send missionaries to their
brethren in Britain!</p>

<p>These reflections, however, did not spoil my appetite, for I
confess a feeling of unusual content and relish when the patriarch
sat down with me before the covered bowls prepared for our supper.
But, alas! for human hopes and tastes! As I lifted the
lid from the vessel containing the steaming stew, its powerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
fragrance announced the remains of that venerable quadruped
with which I had been welcomed. It was probably not quite in
etiquette among the Bagers to decline the stew, yet, had starvation
depended on it, I could not have touched a morsel. Accordingly,
I forbore the mess and made free with the rice, seasoning
it well with salt and peppers. But my amiable landlord
was resolved that I should not go to rest with such penitential
fare, and ordered one of his wives to bring her supper to my
lodge. A taste of the dish satisfied me that it was edible,
though intensely peppered. I ate with the appetite of an alderman,
nor was it till two days after that my trader informed
me I had supped so heartily on the spareribs of an alligator!
It was well that the hours of digestion had gone by, for though
partial to the chase, I had never loved &ldquo;water fowl&rdquo; of so wild
a character.</p>

<p>When supper was over, I escaped from the hut to breathe a
little fresh air before retiring for the night. Hardly had I put
my head outside when I found myself literally inhaling the mosquitoes
that swarmed at nightfall over these marshy flats. I
took it for granted that there was to be no rest for me in darkness
among the Bagers; but, when I mentioned my trouble to
the chief, he told me that another hut had already been provided
for my sleeping quarters, where my bed was made of certain
green and odorous leaves which are antidotes to mosquitoes.
After a little more chat, he offered to guide me to the hovel, a
low, thickly matted bower, through whose single aperture I
crawled on hands and knees. As soon as I was in, the entrance
was closed, and although I felt very much as if packed in my
grave, I slept an unbroken sleep till day-dawn.<a name="FNanchor_D_6" id="FNanchor_D_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_6" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
My return to the Rio Pongo was attended with considerable
danger, yet I did not regret the trial of my spirit, as it
enabled me to see a phase of African character which otherwise
might have been missed.</p>

<p>After passing two days among the Bagers, I departed once
more in my canoe, impelled by the stout muscles of the Kroomen.
The breeze freshened as we passed from the river&rsquo;s mouth
across the boiling surf of the bar, but, when we got fairly to sea,
I found the Atlantic so vexed by the rising gale, that, in spite
of waterproof awning and diligent bailing, we were several times
near destruction. Still, I had great confidence in the native
boatmen, whose skill in their skiffs is quite as great as their
dexterity when naked in the water. I had often witnessed their
agility as they escaped from capsized boats on the surf of our bar;
and often had I rewarded them with a dram, when they came,
as from a frolic, dripping and laughing to the beach.</p>

<p>When night began to fall around us the storm increased, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
I could detect, by the low chatter and anxious looks of the
rowers, that they were alarmed. As far as my eye reached
landward, I could descry nothing but a continuous reef on which
the chafed sea was dashing furiously in columns of the densest
spray. Of course I felt that it was not my duty, nor would it
be prudent, to undertake the guidance of the canoe in such circumstances.
Yet, I confess that a shudder ran through my
nerves when I saw my &ldquo;head-man&rdquo; suddenly change our course
and steer the skiff directly towards the rocks. On she bounded
like a racer. The sea through which they urged her foamed like
a caldron with the rebounding surf. Nothing but wave-lashed
rock was before us. At last I could detect a narrow gap in the
iron wall, which was filled with surges in the heaviest swells.
We approached it, and paused at the distance of fifty feet. A
wave had just burst through the chasm like a storming army.
We waited for the succeeding lull. All hands laid still,&mdash;not a
word was spoken or paddle dipped. Then came the next enormous
swell under our stern;&mdash;the oars flew like lightning;&mdash;the
canoe rose as a feather on the crest of the surf;&mdash;in a moment
she shot through the cleft and reposed in smooth water near the
shore. As we sped through the gap, I might have touched the
rocks on both sides with my extended arms!</p>

<p>Such is the skill and daring of Kroomen.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_6" id="Footnote_D_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_6"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> These Bagers are remarkable for their honesty, as I was convinced
by several anecdotes related, during my stay in this village, by my trading
clerk. He took me to a neighboring lemon-tree, and exhibited an English
brass steelyard hanging on its branches, which had been left there by a
mulatto merchant from Sierra Leone, who died in the town on a trading
trip. This article, with a chest half full of goods, deposited in the &ldquo;palaver-house,&rdquo;
had been kept securely more than twelve years in expectation
that some of his friends would send for them from the colony. The Bagers,
I was told, have no <i>jujus</i>, <i>fetiches</i>, or <i>gree-grees</i>;&mdash;they worship no god or
evil spirit;&mdash;their dead are buried without tears or ceremony;&mdash;and their
hereafter in eternal oblivion.</p>

<p>The males of this tribe are of middling size and deep black color; broad-shouldered,
but neither brave nor warlike. They keep aloof from other
tribes, and by a Fullah law, are protected from foreign violence in consequence
of their occupation as salt-makers, which is regarded by the interior
natives as one of the most useful trades. Their fondness for palm-oil
and the little work they are compelled to perform, make them generally
indolent. Their dress is a single handkerchief, or a strip of country
cloth four or five inches wide, most carefully put on.</p>

<p>The young women have none of the sylphlike appearance of the Mandingoes
or Soosoos. They work hard and use palm-oil plentifully both internally
and externally, so that their relaxed flesh is bloated like blubber.
Both sexes shave their heads, and adorn their noses and lower lips with
rings, while they penetrate their ears with porcupine quills or sticks.
<i>They neither sell nor buy each other</i>, though they acquire children of both
sexes from other tribes, and adopt them into their own, or dispose of them
if not suitable. Their avails of work are commonly divided; so the Bagers
may be said to resemble the Mormons in polygamy, the Fourierites in community,
but to exceed both in honesty!</p>

<p>I am sorry that their nobler characteristics have so few imitators among
the other tribes of Africa.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>When the rains began to slacken, a petty caravan now and then
straggled towards the coast; but, as I was only a new comer in
the region, and not possessed of abundant means, I enjoyed a
slender share of the trade. Still I consoled myself with the hope
of better luck in the dry season.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, I not only heard of Joseph&rsquo;s safe
arrival at Matanzas, but received a clerk whom he dispatched to
dwell in Kambia while I visited the interior. Moreover, I built
a boat, and sent her to Sierra Leone with a cargo of palm-oil, to
be exchanged for British goods; and, finally, during my perfect
leisure, I went to work with diligence <i>to study</i> the trade in which
fortune seemed to have cast my lot.</p>

<p>It would be a task of many pages if I attempted to give a
full account of the origin and causes of <i>slavery in Africa</i>. As
a national institution, it seems to have existed always. Africans
have been bondsmen every where: and the oldest monuments bear
their images linked with menial toils and absolute servitude.
Still, I have no hesitation in saying, that three fourths of the
slaves <i>sent abroad</i> from Africa are the fruit of native wars,
fomented by the avarice and temptation of our own race. I
cannot exculpate any commercial nation from this sweeping
censure. We stimulate the negro&rsquo;s passions by the introduction
of wants and fancies never dreamed of by the simple native,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
while slavery was an institution of domestic need and comfort
alone. But what was once a luxury has now ripened into an
absolute necessity; so that <span class="smcap lowercase">MAN</span>, <i>in truth, has become the coin
of Africa, and the &ldquo;legal tender&rdquo; of a brutal trade</i>.</p>

<p>England, to-day, with all her philanthropy, sends, under the
cross of St. George, to convenient magazines of <i>lawful commerce</i>
on the coast, her Birmingham muskets, Manchester cottons, and
Liverpool lead, all of which are righteously swapped at Sierra
Leone, Acra, and on the Gold coast, for Spanish or Brazilian
bills on London. Yet, what British merchant does not know
the traffic on which those bills are founded, and for whose support
his wares are purchased? France, with her <i>bonnet rouge</i>
and fraternity, dispatches her Rouen cottons, Marseilles brandies,
flimsy taffetas, and indescribable variety of tinsel gewgaws.
Philosophic Germany demands a slice for her looking-glasses and
beads; while multitudes of our own worthy traders, who would
hang a slaver as a pirate <i>when caught</i>, do not hesitate to supply
him indirectly with tobacco, powder, cotton, Yankee rum, and
New England notions, in order to bait the trap in which he <i>may</i>
be caught! It is the temptation of these things, I repeat, that
feeds the slave-making wars of Africa, and forms the human
basis of those admirable bills of exchange.</p>

<p>I did not intend to write a homily on Ethiopian commerce
when I begun this chapter; but, on reviewing the substantial
motives of the traffic, I could not escape a statement which tells
its own tale, and is as unquestionable as the facts of verified history.</p>

<p>Such, then, may be said to be the <i>predominating</i> influence
that supports the African slave-trade; yet, if commerce of all
kinds were forbidden with that continent, the customs and laws
of the natives would still encourage slavery as a domestic affair,
though, of course, in a very modified degree. The rancorous
family quarrels among tribes and parts of tribes, will always
promote conflicts that resemble the forays of our feudal ancestors,
while the captives made therein will invariably become
serfs.</p>

<p>Besides this, the financial genius of Africa, instead of devising
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
bank notes or the precious metals as a circulating medium, has
from time immemorial, declared that a human creature,&mdash;<i>the true
representative and embodiment of labor</i>,&mdash;is the most valuable
article on earth. A man, therefore, becomes the standard of
prices. A slave is a note of hand, that may be discounted or
pawned; he is a bill of exchange that carries himself to his destination
and pays a debt bodily; he is a tax that walks corporeally
into the chieftain&rsquo;s treasury. Thus, slavery is not likely to be
surrendered by the negroes themselves as a national institution.
Their social interests will continue to maintain hereditary bondage;
they will send the felon and the captive to foreign <i>barracoons</i>;
and they will sentence to domestic servitude the orphans
of culprits, disorderly children, gamblers, witches, vagrants,
cripples, insolvents, the deaf, the mute, the barren, and the
faithless. Five-sixths of the population is in chains.<a name="FNanchor_3_7" id="FNanchor_3_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_7" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>To facilitate the sale of these various unfortunates or malefactors,
there exists among the Africans a numerous class of brokers,
who are as skilful in their traffic as the jockeys of civilized
lands. These adroit scoundrels rove the country in search of
objects to suit different patrons. They supply the body-guard of
princes; procure especial tribes for personal attendants; furnish
laborers for farms; fill the <i>harems</i> of debauchees; pay or collect
debts in flesh; and in cases of emergency take the place of
bailiffs, to kidnap under the name of sequestration. If a native
king lacks cloth, arms, powder, balls, tobacco, rum, or salt, and
does not trade personally with the factories on the beach, he
employs one of these dexterous gentry to effect the barter; and
thus both British cotton and Yankee rum ascend the rivers from
the second hands into which they have passed, while the slave
approaches the coast to become the ebony basis of a bill of exchange!</p>

<p>It has sometimes struck me as odd, how the extremes of society
almost meet on similar principles; and how much some
African short-comings resemble the conceded civilizations of other
lands!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>The month of November, 1827, brought the wished-for &ldquo;dry
season;&rdquo; and with it came a message from the leader of a caravan,
that, at the full of the moon, he would halt in my village
with all the produce he could impress. The runner represented
his master as bearing a missive from his beloved nephew Ahmah-de-Bellah,
and declared that he only lingered on the path to swell
his caravan for the profit of my coffers.</p>

<p>I did not let the day pass before I sent an interpreter to greet
my promised guest with suitable presents; while I took advantage
of his delay to build a neat cottage for his reception, inasmuch
as no Fullah Mahometan will abide beneath the same roof
with an infidel. I furnished the establishment, according to their
taste, with green hides and several fresh mats.</p>

<p>True to his word, Mami-de-Yong made known his arrival in
my neighborhood on the day when the planet attained its full
diameter. The moment the pious Mussulman, from the high
hills in the rear of my settlement, espied the river winding to the
sea, he turned to the east, and raising his arms to heaven, and
extending them towards Mecca, gave thanks for his safe arrival
on the beach. After repeated genuflections, in which the earth
was touched by his prostrate forehead, he arose, and taking
the path towards Kambia, struck up a loud chant in honor of
the prophet, in which he was joined by the interminable procession.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
It was quite an imposing sight&mdash;this Oriental parade and
barbaric pomp. My native landlord, proud of the occasion, as
well as of his Mahometan progenitors, joined in the display. As
the train approached my establishment, I ordered repeated salutes
in honor of the stranger, and as I had no minstrels or music to
welcome the Fullah, I commanded my master of ceremonies to
conceal the deficiency by plenty of smoke and a dozen more
rounds of rattling musketry.</p>

<p>This was the first caravan and the first leader of absolutely
royal pretensions that visited my settlement; so I lined my
piazza with mats, put a body-guard under arms behind me, decorated
the front with fancy flags, and opposite the stool where I
took my seat, caused a pure white sheepskin of finest wool
to be spread for the accommodation of the noble savage. Advancing
to the steps of my dwelling, I stood uncovered as the
Fullah approached and tendered me a silver-mounted gazelle-horn
snuff-box&mdash;the credential by which Ahmah-de-Bellah had
agreed to certify the mission. Receiving the token with a <i>salaam</i>,
I carried it reverently to my forehead, and passed it to Ali-Ninpha,
who, on this occasion, played the part of my scribe.
The ceremony over, we took him by the hands and led him to
his allotted sheepskin, while, with a bow, I returned to my stool.</p>

<p>According to &ldquo;country custom,&rdquo; Mami-de-Yong then began
the <i>dantica</i>, or exposition of purposes, first of all invoking
<span class="smcap">Allah</span> to witness his honor and sincerity. &ldquo;Not only,&rdquo; said
the Mussulman, &ldquo;am I the bearer of a greeting from my dear
nephew Ahmah-de-Bellah, but I am an envoy from my royal master
the Ali-Mami, of Footha-Yallon, who, at his son&rsquo;s desire, has
sent me with an escort to conduct you on your promised visit to
Timbo. During your absence, my lord has commanded us to
dwell in your stead at Kambia, so that your property may be
safe from the Mulatto Mongo of Bangalang, whose malice
towards your person has been heard of even among our distant
hills!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latter portion of this message somewhat surprised me,
for though my relations with Mongo John were by no means
amicable, I did not imagine that the story of our rupture had
spread so far, or been received with so much sympathy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
Accordingly, when Mami-de-Yong finished his message, I approached
him with thanks for his master&rsquo;s interest in my welfare;
and, placing Ahmah-de-Bellah&rsquo;s Koran&mdash;which I had previously
wrapped in a white napkin&mdash;in his hands, as a token of
the nephew&rsquo;s friendship, I retired once more to my seat. As
soon as the holy book appeared from the folds, Mami-de-Yong
drew a breath of surprise, and striking his breast, fell on his
knees with his head on the ground, where he remained for several
minutes apparently in rapt devotion. As he rose&mdash;his forehead
sprinkled with dust, and his eyes sparkling with tears&mdash;he
opened the volume, and pointed out to me and his people his
own handwriting, which he translated to signify that &ldquo;Mami-de-Yong
gave this word of God to Ahmah-de-Bellah, his kinsman.&rdquo;
At the reading of the sentence, all the Fullahs shouted, &ldquo;Glory
to Allah and Mahomet his Prophet!&rdquo; Then, coming forward
again to the chief, I laid my hand on the Koran, and swore by
the help of God, to accept the invitation of the great king of
Footha-Yallon.</p>

<p>This terminated the ceremonial reception, after which I hastened
to conduct Mami-de-Yong to his quarters, where I presented
him with a sparkling new kettle and an inkstand, letting
him understand, moreover, I was specially anxious to know that
all the wants of his attendants in the caravan were completely
satisfied.</p>

<p>Next morning early, I remembered the joy of his nephew
Ahmah-de-Bellah, when I first treated him to <i>coffee</i>; and determined
to welcome the chief, as soon as he came forth from his
ablutions to prayers, with a cup distilled from the fragrant berry.
I could not have hit upon a luxury more gratifying to the old
gentleman. Thirty years before had he drank it in Timbuctoo,
where it is used, he said, by the Moses-people (meaning the Hebrews),
with milk and honey; and its delicious aroma brought the
well-remembered taste to his lips ere they touched the sable fluid.</p>

<p>Long before Mami-de-Yong&rsquo;s arrival, his fame as a learned
&ldquo;book-man&rdquo; and extensive traveller preceded him, so that when
he mentioned his travel to Timbuctoo, I begged him to give me
some account of that &ldquo;capital of capitals,&rdquo; as the Africans call
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
it. The royal messenger promised to comply as soon as he finished
the morning lessons of the caravan&rsquo;s children. His quarters
were filled with a dozen or more of young Fullahs and
Mandingoes squatted around a fire, while the prince sat apart
in a corner with inkstand, writing reeds, and a pile of old manuscripts.
Ali-Ninpha, our backsliding Mahometan, stood by, pretending
devoted attention to Mami&rsquo;s precepts and the Prophet&rsquo;s
versus. The sinner was a scrupulous follower in the presence of
the faithful; but when their backs were turned, I know few
who relished a porker more lusciously, or avoided water with
more scrupulous care. Yet why should I scoff at poor Ali? Joseph
and I had done our best to <i>civilize</i> him!</p>

<p>Mami-de-Yong apologized for the completion of his daily task
in my presence, and went on with his instruction, while the
pupils wrote down notes, on wooden slabs, with reeds and a fluid
made of powder dissolved in water.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that these Ethiopian Mahometans are but
poor scholars. Their entire instruction amounts to little more
than the Koran, and when they happen to write or receive a
letter, its interpretation is a matter over which many an hour is
toilsomely spent. Mami-de-Yong, however, was superior to most
of his countrymen; and, in fact, I must record him in my narrative
as the most erudite Negro I ever encountered.</p>


<h3>HIS TRIP TO TIMBUCTOO.</h3>

<p>True to his promise, the envoy came to my piazza, as soon as
school was over, and squatting sociably on our mats and sheepskins,
with a plentiful supply of pipes and tobacco, we formed
as pleasant a little party as was assembled that day on the banks
of the Rio Pongo. Ali-Ninpha acted as interpreter, having prepared
himself for the long-winded task by a preliminary dram
from my private locker, out of sight of the noble Mahometan.</p>

<p>Invoking the Lord&rsquo;s name,&mdash;as is usual among Mussulmen,&mdash;Mami-de-Yong
took a long whiff at his pipe, and, receiving
from his servant a small bag of fine sand, spread it smoothly
on the floor, leaving the mass about a quarter of an inch in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
thickness. This was his black-board, designed to serve for
the delineation of his journey. On the westernmost margin of
his sand, he dotted a point with his finger for the starting at
Timbo. As he proceeded with his track over Africa towards
the grand capital, he marked the outlines of the principal territories,
and spotted the remarkable towns through which he
passed. By a thick or thin line, he denoted the large rivers and
small streams that intercepted his path, while he heaved up the
sand into heaps to represent a mountain, or smoothed it into perfect
levels to imitate the broad prairies and savannas of the interior.
When he came to a dense forest, his snuff-box was
called in requisition, and a pinch or two judiciously sprinkled,
stood for the monarchs of the wood.</p>

<p>Like all Oriental story-tellers, Mami proved rather prolix.
His tale was nearly as long as his travel. He insisted on describing
his reception at every village. At each river he had his
story of difficulty and danger in constructing rafts or building
bridges. He counted the minutes he lost in awaiting the diminution
of floods. Anon, he would catalogue the various fish with
which a famous river teemed; and, when he got fairly into the
woods, there was no end of adventures and hairbreadth escapes
from alligators, elephants, anacondas, vipers, and the fatal tape
snake, whose bite is certain death. In the mountains he encountered
wolves, wild asses, hy&aelig;nas, zebras, and eagles.</p>

<p>In fact, the whole morning glided away with a geographical,
zoological, and statistical overture to his tour; so that, when
the hour of prayer and ablution arrived, Mami-de-Yong had
not yet reached Timbuctoo! The double rite of cleanliness and
faith required him to pause in his narrative; and, apologizing
for the interruption, he left a slave to guard the map while he
retired to perform his religious services.</p>

<p>When the noble Fullah got back, I had a nice lunch prepared
on a napkin in the neighborhood of his diagram, so that he could
munch his biscuits and sugar without halting on his path. Before
he began, however, I took the liberty to offer a hint about the
precious value of time in this brief life of ours, whilst I asked
a question or two about the &ldquo;capital of capitals,&rdquo; to indicate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
my eagerness to enter the walls of Timbuctoo. Mami-de-Yong,
who was a man of tact as well as humor, smiled at my insinuation,
and apologizing like a Christian for the natural tediousness
of all old travellers, skipped a degree or two of the wilderness,
and at once stuck his buffalo-horn snuff-box into the eastern
margin of the sand, to indicate that he was at his journey&rsquo;s end.</p>

<p>Mami had visited many of the European colonies and Moorish
kingdoms on the north coast of Africa, so that he enjoyed
the advantage of comparison, and, of course, was not stupefied
by the untravelled ignorance of Africans who consider Timbuctoo
a combination of Paris and paradise. Indeed, he did not presume,
like most of the Mandingo chiefs, to prefer it to Senegal
or Sierra Leone. He confessed that the royal palace was nothing
but a vast inclosure of mud walls, built without taste or symmetry,
within whose labyrinthine mesh there were numerous
buildings for the wives, children, and kindred of the sovereign.
If the royal palace of Timbuctoo was of <i>such</i> a character,&mdash;&ldquo;What,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;were the dwellings of nobles and townsfolk?&rdquo;
The streets were paths;&mdash;the stores were shops;&mdash;the
suburb of an European colony was <i>superior</i> to their best display!
The markets of Timbuctoo, alone, secured his admiration. Every
week they were thronged with traders, dealers, peddlers and
merchants, who either dwelt in the neighboring kingdoms, or
came from afar with slaves and produce. Moors and Israelites,
from the north-east, were the most eminent and opulent merchants;
and among them he counted a travelling class, crowned
with peculiar turbans, whom he called &ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s-people,&rdquo; or, in
all likelihood, Armenians.</p>

<p>The prince had no mercy on the government of this influential
realm. Strangers, he said, were watched and taxed. Indeed,
he spoke of it with the peculiar love that we would suppose
a Hungarian might bear towards Austria, or a Milanese to
the inquisitorial powers of Lombardy. In fact, I found that,
despite of its architectural meanness, Timbuctoo was a great
central mart for exchange, and that commercial men as well as
the innumerable petty kings, frequented it not only for the
abundant mineral salt in its vicinity, <i>but because they could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
exchange their slaves for foreign merchandise</i>. I asked the Fullah
why he preferred the markets of Timbuctoo to the well-stocked
stores of regular European settlements on a coast which was
reached with so much more ease than this core of Africa?
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the astute trafficker, &ldquo;no market is a good one for
the genuine African, in which he cannot openly exchange his
<i>blacks</i> for whatever the original owner or importer can sell without
fear! <i>Slaves, Don T&eacute;odore, are our money!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer solved in my mind one of the political problems
in the question of African civilization, which I shall probably develope
in the course of this narrative.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>Having completed the mercantile negotiations of the caravan,
and made my personal arrangements for a protracted absence, I
put the noble Fullah in charge of my establishment, with special
charges to my retainers, clerks, runners, and villagers, to regard
the Mami as my second self. I thought it well, moreover, before
I plunged into the wilderness,&mdash;leaving my worldly goods
and worldly prospects in charge of a Mussulman stranger,&mdash;to
row down to Bangalang for a parting chat with Mongo John,
in which I might sound the veteran as to his feeling and projects.
Ormond was in trouble as soon as I appeared. He was willing
enough that I might perish by treachery on the roadside, yet he
was extremely reluctant that I should penetrate Africa and
make alliances which should give me superiority over the monopolists
of the beach. I saw these things passing through his jealous
heart as we talked together with uncordial civility. At parting
I told the Mongo, for the first time, that I was sure my establishment
would not go to decay or suffer harm in my absence,
inasmuch as that powerful Fullah, the Ali-Mami of Footha-Yallon
had deputed a lieutenant to watch Kambia while I travelled,
and that he would occupy my village with his chosen warriors.
The mulatto started with surprise as I finished, and abruptly left
the apartment in silence.</p>

<p>I slept well that night, notwithstanding the Mongo&rsquo;s displeasure.
My confidence in the Fullah was perfect. Stranger
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
as he was, I had an instinctive reliance on his protection of my
home, and his guardianship of my person through the wilderness.</p>

<p>At day-dawn I was up. It was a fresh and glorious morning.
As nature awoke in the woods of that primitive world, the mists
stole off from the surface of the water; and, as the first rays
shot through the glistening dew of the prodigious vegetation, a
thousand birds sent forth their songs as if to welcome me into
their realm of unknown paths.</p>

<p>After a hearty breakfast my Spanish clerk was furnished with
minute instructions in writing, and, at the last moment, I presented
the Fullah chief to my people as a temporary master to
whom they were to pay implicit obedience for his generous
protection. By ten o&rsquo;clock, my caravan was in motion. It consisted
of thirty individuals deputed by Ahmah-de-Bellah, headed
by one of his relations as captain. Ten of my own servants
were assigned to carry baggage, merchandise, and provisions;
while Ali-Ninpha, two interpreters, my body-servant, a waiter, and
a hunter, composed my immediate guard. In all, there were
about forty-five persons.</p>

<p>When we were starting, Mami-de-Yong approached to &ldquo;snap
fingers,&rdquo; and put in my hands a verse of the Koran in his master&rsquo;s
handwriting,&mdash;&ldquo;hospitality to the wearied stranger is the
road to heaven,&rdquo;&mdash;which was to serve me as a passport among all
good Mahometans. If I had time, no doubt I would have
thought how much more Christian this document was than the
formal paper with which we are fortified by &ldquo;foreign offices&rdquo;
and &ldquo;state departments,&rdquo; when we go abroad from civilized
lands;&mdash;but, before I could summon so much sentiment, the
Fullah chief stooped to the earth, and filling his hands with dust,
sprinkled it over our heads, in token of a prosperous journey.
Then, prostrating himself with his head on the ground, he bade
us &ldquo;go our way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I believe I have already said that even the best of African
roads are no better than goat-paths, and barely sufficient for the
passage of a single traveller. Accordingly, our train marched
off in single file. Two men, cutlass in hand, armed, besides, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
loaded muskets, went in advance not only to scour the way and
warn us of danger, but to cut the branches and briers that soon
impede an untravelled path in this prolific land. They marched
within hail of the caravan, and shouted whenever we approached
bee-trees, ant-hills, hornet-nests, reptiles, or any of the Ethiopian
perils that are unheard of in our American forests. Behind
these pioneers, came the porters with food and luggage; the centre
of the caravan was made up of women, children, guards, and
followers; while the rear was commanded by myself and the
chiefs, who, whips in hand, found it sometimes beneficial to
stimulate the steps of stragglers. As we crossed the neighboring
Soosoo towns, our imposing train was saluted with discharges
of musketry, while crowds of women and children followed
their &ldquo;<i>cupy</i>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;white-man,&rdquo; to bid him farewell on the border
of the settlement.</p>

<p>For a day or two our road passed through a rolling country,
interspersed with forests, cultivated fields, and African villages,
in which we were welcomed by the generous chiefs with <i>bungees</i>,
or trifling gifts, in token of amity. Used to the scant exercise
of a lazy dweller on the coast, whose migrations are confined to
a journey from his house to the landing, and from the landing to
his house, it required some time to habituate me once more to
walking. By degrees, however, I overcame the foot-sore weariness
that wrapped me in perfect lassitude when I sank into my
hammock on the first night of travel. However, as we became better
acquainted with each other and with wood-life, we tripped along
merrily in the shadowy silence of the forest,&mdash;singing, jesting,
and praising Allah. Even the slaves were relaxed into familiarity
never permitted in the towns; while masters would sometimes
be seen relieving the servants by bearing their burdens. At nightfall
the women brought water, cooked food, and distributed rations;
so that, after four days pleasant wayfaring in a gentle
trot, our dusty caravan halted at sunset before the closed gates
of a fortified town belonging to Ibrahim Ali, the Mandingo chief
of Kya.</p>

<p>It was some time before our shouts and beating on the gates
aroused the watchman to answer our appeal, for it was the hour
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
of prayer, and Ibrahim was at his devotions. At last, pestered
by their dalliance, I fired my double-barrelled gun, whose loud
report I knew was more likely to reach the ear of a praying
Mussulman. I did not reckon improperly, for hardly had the
echoes died away before the great war-drum of the town was rattled,
while a voice from a loophole demanded our business. I
left the negotiation for our entry to the Fullah chief, who forthwith
answered that &ldquo;the <i>Ali-Mami&rsquo;s</i> caravan, laden with goods,
demanded hospitality;&rdquo; while Ali-Ninpha informed the questioner,
that Don T&eacute;odore, the &ldquo;white man of Kambia,&rdquo; craved
admittance to the presence of Ibrahim the faithful.</p>

<p>In a short time the wicket creaked, and Ibrahim himself put
forth his head to welcome the strangers, and to admit them, one
by one, into the town. His reception of myself and Ali-Ninpha
was extremely cordial; but the Fullah chief was addressed with
cold formality, for the Mandingoes have but little patience with
the well-known haughtiness of their national rivals.</p>

<p>Ali-Ninpha had been Ibrahim&rsquo;s playmate before he migrated
to the coast. Their friendship still existed in primitive sincerity,
and the chieftain&rsquo;s highest ambition was to honor the
companion and guest of his friend. Accordingly, his wives and
females were summoned to prepare my quarters with comfort and
luxury. The best house was chosen for my lodging. The
earthen floor was spread with mats. Hides were stretched on
<i>adobe</i> couches, and a fire was kindled to purify the atmosphere.
Pipes were furnished my companions; and, while a hammock
was slung for my repose before supper, a chosen henchman was
dispatched to seek the fattest sheep for that important meal.</p>

<p>Ibrahim posted sentinels around my hut, so that my slumbers
were uninterrupted, until Ali-Ninpha roused me with the
pleasant news that the bowls of rice and stews were smoking on
the mat in the chamber of Ibrahim himself. Ninpha knew my
tastes and superintended the cook. He had often jested at the
&ldquo;white man&rsquo;s folly,&rdquo; when my stomach turned at some disgusting
dish of the country; so that the pure roasts and broils of
well-known pieces slipped down my throat with the appetite of a
trooper. While these messes were under discussion, the savory
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span>
steam of a rich stew with a creamy sauce saluted my nostrils,
and, without asking leave, I plunged my spoon into a dish that
stood before my entertainers, and seemed prepared exclusively
for themselves. In a moment I was invited to partake of the
<i>bonne-bouche</i>; and so delicious did I find it, that, even at this
distance of time, my mouth waters when I remember the forced-meat
balls of mutton, minced with roasted ground-nuts, that I
devoured that night in the Mandingo town of Kya.</p>

<p>But the best of feasts is dull work without an enlivening
bowl. Water alone&mdash;pure and cool as it was in this hilly region&mdash;did
not quench our thirst. Besides this, I recollected the
fondness of my landlord, Ali-Ninpha, for strong distillations, and
I guessed that his playmate might indulge, at least privately, in
a taste for similar libations. I spoke, therefore, of &ldquo;cordial bitters,&rdquo;&mdash;(a
name not unfamiliar even to the most temperate
Christians, in defence of flatulent stomachs,)&mdash;and at the same
time producing my travelling canteen of Otard&rsquo;s best, applied it
to the nostrils of the pair.</p>

<p>I know not how it happened, but before I could warn the
Mahometans of the risk they incurred, the lips of the bottle slid
from their noses to their mouths, while upheaved elbows long
sustained in air, gave notice that the flask was relishing and the
draft &ldquo;good for their complaints.&rdquo; Indeed, so appetizing was
the liquor, that another ground-nut stew was demanded; and,
of course, another bottle was required to allay its dyspeptic
qualities.</p>

<p>By degrees, the brandy did its work on the worthy Mahometans.
While it restored Ali-Ninpha to his early faith, and
brought him piously to his knees with prayers to Allah, it had a
contrary effect on Ibrahim, whom it rendered wild and generous.
Every thing was mine;&mdash;house, lands, slaves, and children. He
dwelt rapturously on the beauty of his wives, and kissed Ali-Ninpha
in mistake for one of them. This only rendered the
apostate more devout than ever, and set him roaring invocations
like a muezzin from a minaret. In the midst of these orgies, I
stole off at midnight, and was escorted by my servant to a
delicious hammock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
It was day-dawn when the caravan&rsquo;s crier aroused me, as he
stood on a house-top calling the faithful to prayer previous to
our departure. Before I could stir, Ali-Ninpha, haggard, sick,
and crest-fallen, from his debauch, rolled into my chamber, and
begged the postponement of our departure, as it was impossible
for <i>Ibrahim Ali</i> to appear, being perfectly vanquished by&mdash;&ldquo;the
bitters!&rdquo; The poor devil hiccoughed between his words, and
so earnestly and with so many bodily gyrations implored my interference
with the Fullah guide, that I saw at once he was in no
condition to travel.</p>

<p>As the caravan was my personal escort and designed exclusively
for my convenience, I did not hesitate to command a halt,
especially as I was in some measure the cause of my landlord&rsquo;s
malady. Accordingly, I tied a kerchief round my head, covered
myself with a cloak, and leaning very lackadaisically on the
edge of my hammock, sent for the Fullah chief.</p>

<p>I moaned with pain as he approached, and, declaring that I
was prostrated by sudden fever, hoped he would indulge me by
countermanding the order for our march. I do not know
whether the worthy Mussulman understood my case or believed
my fever, but the result was precisely the same, for he assented
to my request like a gentleman, and expressed the deepest sympathy
with my sufferings. His next concern was for my cure.
True to the superstition and bigotry of his country, the good-natured
Fullah insisted on taking the management of matters
into his own hands, and forthwith prescribed a dose from the
Koran, diluted in water, which he declared was a specific remedy
for my complaint. I smiled at the idea of making a drug of
divinity, but as I knew that hom&oelig;opathy was harmless under the
circumstances, I requested the Fullah to prepare his physic on
the spot. The chief immediately brought his Koran, and turning
over the leaves attentively for some time, at last hit on the
appropriate verse, which he wrote down on a board with gunpowder
ink, which he washed off into a bowl with clean water. This
was given me to swallow, and the Mahometan left me to the
operation of his religious charm, with special directions to the
servant to allow no one to disturb my rest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
I have no doubt that the Fullah was somewhat of a quiz,
and thought a chapter in his Bible a capital lesson after a reckless
debauch; so I ordered my door to be barricaded, and slept
like a dormouse, until Ibrahim and Ali-Ninpha came thundering
at the portal long after mid-day. They were sadly chopfallen.
Penitence spoke from their aching brows; nor do I hesitate to
believe they were devoutly sincere when they forswore &ldquo;<i>bitters</i>&rdquo;
for the future. In order to allay suspicion, or quiet his conscience,
the Fullah had been presented with a magnificent ram-goat,
flanked by baskets of choicest rice.</p>

<p>When I sallied forth into the town with the suffering sinners,
I found the sun fast declining in the west, and, although my
fever had left me, it was altogether too late to depart from the
village on our journey. I mentioned to Ibrahim a report on the
coast that his town was bordered by a sacred spring known as
the <span class="smcap">Devil&rsquo;s Fountain</span>, and inquired whether daylight enough
still remained to allow us a visit. The chief assented; and as
in his generous fit last night, he had offered me a horse, I now
claimed the gift, and quickly mounted in search of the aqueous
demon.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>Ah! what joy, after so many years, to be once more in the
saddle in an open country, with a steed of fire and spirit bounding
beneath my exhilarated frame! It was long before I could
consent to obey the summons of our guide to follow him on the path.
When the gates of Kya were behind, and the wider roads opened
invitingly before me, I could not help giving rein to the mettlesome
beast, as he dashed across the plain beneath the arching
branches of magnificent cotton-woods. The solitude and the motion
were both delightful. Never, since I last galloped from the
<i>paseo</i> to Atares, and from Atares to El Principe, overlooking
the beautiful bay of Havana, and the distant outline of her
purple sea, had I felt so gloriously the rush of joyous blood that
careered through my veins like electric fire. Indeed, I know
not how long I would have traversed the woods had not the
path suddenly ended at a town, where my Arabian turned of his
own accord, and dashed back along the road till I met my wondering
companions.</p>

<p>Having sobered both our bloods, I felt rather better prepared
for a visit to the Satanic personage who was the object of our
excursion. About two miles from Kya, we struck the foot of
a steep hill, some three hundred feet in height, over whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
shoulder we reached a deep and tangled dell, watered by a slender
stream which was hemmed in by a profusion of shrubbery.
Crossing the brook, we ascended the opposite declivity for a short
distance till we approached a shelving precipice of rock, along
whose slippery side the ledgelike path continued. I passed it at
a bound, and instantly stood within the arched aperture of a deep
cavern, whence a hot and sulphurous stream trickled slowly
towards the ravine. This was the fountain, and the demon who
presided over its source dwelt within the cave.</p>

<p>Whilst I was examining the rocks to ascertain their quality,
the guide apprised me that the impish proprietor of these waters
was gifted with a &ldquo;multitude of tongues,&rdquo; and, in all probability,
would reply to me in my own, if I thought fit to address him.
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the savage, &ldquo;he will answer you <i>word for word</i>
and that, too, almost before you can shape your thought in
language. Let us see if he is at home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I called, in a loud voice, &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Kya</span>!&rdquo; but as no reply followed,
I perceived at once the wit of the imposture, and without waiting
for him to place me, took my own position at a spot inside the
cavern, where I knew the <i>echoes</i> would be redoubled. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;I know the devil is at home, as well as you do;&rdquo;&mdash;and,
telling my people to listen, I bellowed, with all my might&mdash;&ldquo;<i>caffra
fure!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;infernal black one!&rdquo;&mdash;till the resounding
rocks roared again with demoniac responses. In a moment the
cavern was clear of every African; so that I amused myself
letting off shrieks, howls, squeals, and pistols, until the affrighted
natives peeped into the mouth of the cave, thinking the devil in
reality had come for me in a double-breasted garment of thunder
and lightning. I came forth, however, with a whole skin and so
hearty a laugh, that the Africans seized my hands in token of
congratulation, and looked at me with wonderment, as something
greater than the devil himself. Without waiting for a
commentary, I leaped on my Arab and darted down the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said I, when I got back to Kya, &ldquo;dost thou in
truth believe, beloved Ibrahim, that the devil dwells in those
rocks of the sulphur stream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, brother Theodore? Isn&rsquo;t the water poison? If you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
drink, will it not physic you? When animals lick it in the dry
season, do they not die on the margin by scores? Now, a &lsquo;book-man&rsquo;
like you, my brother, knows well enough that <i>water</i> alone
can&rsquo;t kill; so that whenever it does, the devil <i>must</i> be in it;
and, moreover, is it not he who speaks in the cavern?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;but, pry&rsquo;thee, dear Ibrahim, read me
this riddle: if the devil gets into <i>water</i> and kills, why don&rsquo;t he
kill when he gets into &lsquo;<i>bitters</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the Ali&mdash;&ldquo;you white men are infidels and scoffers!&rdquo;
as he laughed like a rollicking trooper, and led me, with
his arm round my neck, into supper. &ldquo;And yet, Don T&eacute;odore,
don&rsquo;t forget the portable imp that you carry in that Yankee
flask in your pocket!&rdquo;</p>

<p>We did not dispute the matter further. I had been long
enough in Africa to find out that white men made themselves odious
to the natives and created bitter enemies, by despising or ridiculing
their errors; and as I was not abroad on a mission of civilization,
I left matters just as I found them. When I was among
the Mahometans, I was an excellent Mussulman, while, among
the heathen, I affected considerable respect for their <i>jujus</i>,
<i>gree-grees</i>, <i>fetiches</i>, <i>snakes</i>, <i>iguanas</i>, <i>alligators</i>, and wooden
images.</p>

<p>Ere we set forth next morning, my noble host caused a generous
meal to be dispensed among the caravan. The breakfast
consisted of boiled rice dried in the sun, and then boiled again
with milk or water after being pounded finely in a mortar. This
nutritive dish was liberally served; and, as a new Mongo, I was
tendered an especial platter, flanked by copious bowls of cream
and honey.</p>

<p>It is true Mandingo etiquette, at the departure of an honored
friend, for the Lord of the Town to escort him on his way to
the first brook, drink of the water with the wayfarer, toast a
prompt return, invoke Allah for a prosperous voyage, shake
bands, and snap fingers, in token of friendly adieu. The host
who tarries then takes post in the path, and, fixing his eyes on
the departing guest, never stirs till the traveller is lost in the
folds of the forest, or sinks behind the distant horizon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
Such was the conduct of my friend Ibrahim on this occasion;
nor was it all. It is a singular habit of these benighted people,
to keep their word whenever they make a promise! I dare
say it is one of the marks of their faint civilization; yet I am
forced to record it as a striking fact. When I sallied forth from
the gate of the town, I noticed a slave holding the horse I rode
the day before to the Devil&rsquo;s fountain, ready caparisoned and
groomed as for a journey. Being accompanied by Ibrahim on
foot, I supposed the animal was designed for his return after our
complimentary adieus. But when we had passed at least a mile
beyond the parting brook, I <i>again</i> encountered the beast, whose
leader approached Ali-Ninpha, announcing the horse as a gift
from his master to help me on my way. Ere I backed the
blooded animal, an order was directed to my clerk at Kambia for
two muskets, two kegs of powder, two pieces of blue cotton, and
one hundred pounds of tobacco. I advised my official, moreover,
to inclose in the core of the tobacco the stoutest flask he could
find of our fourth proof &ldquo;bitters!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>The day was cloudy, but our trotting caravan did not exceed
twenty miles in travel. In Africa things are done leisurely, for
neither life, speculation, nor ambition is so exciting or exacting
as to make any one in a hurry. I do not recollect to have ever
seen an individual <i>in haste</i> while I dwelt in the torrid clime.
The shortest existence is long enough, when it is made up of
sleep, slave-trade, and mastication.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>At sunset no town was in sight; so it was resolved to
bivouac in the forest on the margin of a beautiful brook, where
rice, tea, and beef, were speedily boiled and smoking on the mats.
When I was about to stretch my weary limbs for the night
on the ground, my boy gave me another instance of Ibrahim&rsquo;s
true and heedful hospitality, by producing a grass hammock he
had secretly ordered to be packed among my baggage. With a
hammock and a horse I was on velvet in the forest!</p>

<p>Delicious sleep curtained my swinging couch between two
splendid cotton-woods until midnight, when the arm of our
Fullah chief was suddenly laid on my shoulder with a whispered
call to prepare for defence or flight. As I leaped to the ground
the caravan was already afoot, though the profoundest silence
prevailed throughout the wary crowd. The watch announced
strangers in our neighborhood, and two guides had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
despatched immediately to reconnoitre the forest. This was all the
information they could give me.</p>

<p>The native party was fully prepared and alert with spears,
lances, bows and arrows. I commanded my own men to re-prime
their muskets, pistols, and rifles; so that, when the guides
returned with a report that the intruders were supposed to
form a party of fugitive slaves, we were ready for our customers.</p>

<p>Their capture was promptly determined. Some proposed
we should delay till daylight; but Ali-Ninpha, who was a
sagacious old fighter, thought it best to complete the enterprise
by night, especially as the savages kept up a smouldering fire in
the midst of their sleeping group, which would serve to guide us.</p>

<p>Our little band was immediately divided into two squads, one
under the lead of the Fullah, and the other commanded by Ali-Ninpha.
The Fullah was directed to make a circuit until he got
in the rear of the slaves, while Ali-Ninpha, at a concerted signal,
began to advance towards them from our camp. Half an hour
probably elapsed before a faint call, like the cry of a child, was
heard in the distant forest, upon which the squad of my landlord
fell on all-fours, and crawled cautiously, like cats, through the
short grass and brushwood, in the direction of the sound. The
sleepers were quickly surrounded. The Mandingo gave the signal
as soon as the ends of the two parties met and completed
the circle; and, in an instant, every one of the runaways, except
two, was in the grasp of a warrior, with a cord around his throat.
Fourteen captives were brought into camp. The eldest of the
party alleged that they belonged to the chief of Tamisso, a town
on our path to Timbo, and were bound to the coast for sale. On
their way to the <i>foreign</i> factories, which they were exceedingly
anxious to reach, their owner died, so that they came under the
control of his brother, who threatened to change their destination,
and sell them in the interior. In consequence of this they
fled; and, as their master would surely slay them if restored to
Tamisso, they besought us with tears not to take them thither.</p>

<p>Another council was called, for we were touched by the
earnest manner of the negroes. Ali-Ninpha and the Fullah were
of opinion that the spoil was fairly ours, and should be divided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
in proportion to the men in both parties. Yet, as our road
passed by the objectionable town, it was impossible to carry the
slaves along, either in justice to ourselves or them. In this
strait, which puzzled the Africans sorely, I came to their relief,
by suggesting their dispatch to my factory with orders for the
payment of their value in merchandise.</p>

<p>The proposal was quickly assented to as the most feasible,
and our fourteen captives were at once divided into two gangs, of
seven each. Hoops of bamboo were soon clasped round their
waists, while their hands were tied by stout ropes to the hoops.
A long tether was then passed with a slip-knot through each
rattan belt, so that the slaves were firmly secured to each
other, while a small coil was employed to link them more securely
in a band by their necks. These extreme precautions were
needed, because we dared not diminish our party to guard the
gang. Indeed, Ali-Ninpha was only allowed the two interpreters
and four of my armed people as his escort to Kya, where, it was
agreed, he should deliver the captives to Ibrahim, to be forwarded
to my factory, while he hastened to rejoin us at the river
Sanghu, where we designed tarrying.</p>

<p>For three days we journeyed through the forest, passing
occasionally along the beds of dried-up streams and across lonely
tracts of wood which seemed never to have been penetrated,
save by the solitary path we were treading. As we were anxious
to be speedily reunited with our companions, our steps were not
hastened; so that, at the end of the third day, we had not
advanced more than thirty miles from the scene of capture,
when we reached a small <i>Mandingo</i> village, recently built by an
upstart trader, who, with the common envy and pride of his
tribe, gave our <i>Fullah</i> caravan a frigid reception. A single hut
was assigned to the chief and myself for a dwelling, and the
rage of the Mahometan may readily be estimated by an insult
that would doom him to sleep beneath the same roof with a
Christian!</p>

<p>I endeavored to avert an outburst by apprising the Mandingo
that I was a bosom friend of Ali-Ninpha, his countryman and
superior, and begged that he would suffer the &ldquo;head-man&rdquo; of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
our caravan to dwell in a house <i>alone</i>. But the impudent
<i>parvenu</i> sneered at my advice; &ldquo;he knew no such person as
Ali-Ninpha, and cared not a snap of his finger for a Fullah chief,
or a beggarly white man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My body-servant was standing by when this tart reply fell
from the Mandingo&rsquo;s lips, and, before I could stop the impetuous
youth, he answered the trader with as gross an insult as an
African can utter. To this the Mandingo replied by a blow over
the boy&rsquo;s shoulders with the flat of a cutlass; and, in a twinkling,
there was a general shout for &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; from all my party
who happened to witness the scene. Fullahs, Mandingoes, and
Soosoos dashed to the spot, with spears, guns, and arrows. The
Fullah chief seized my double-barrelled gun and followed the
crowd; and when he reached the spot, seeing the trader still
waving his cutlass in a menacing manner, he pulled both triggers
at the inhospitable savage. Fortunately, however, it was always
my custom on arriving in <i>friendly</i> towns, to remove the copper
caps from my weapons, so that, when the hammers fell, the gun
was silent. Before the Fullah could club the instrument and
prostrate the insulter, I rushed between them to prevent
murder. This I was happy enough to succeed in; but I
could not deter the rival tribe from binding the brute, hand
and foot, to a post in the centre of his town, while the majority
of our caravan cleared the settlement at once of its fifty or sixty
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Of course, we appropriated the dwellings as we pleased, and
supplied ourselves with provisions. Moreover, it was thought
preferable to wait in this village for Ali-Ninpha, than to proceed
onwards towards the borders of the Sanghu. When he arrived,
on the second day after the sad occurrence, he did not hesitate
to exercise the prerogative of judgment and condemnation always
claimed by superior chiefs over inferiors, whenever they consider
themselves slighted or wronged. The process in this case was
calmly and humanely formed. A regular trial was allowed the
culprit. He was arraigned on three charges:&mdash;1. Want of hospitality;
2. Cursing and maltreating a Fullah chief and a white
Mongo; 3. Disrespect to the name and authority of his countryman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
and superior, Ali-Ninpha. On all these articles the prisoner
was found guilty; but, as there were neither slaves nor personal
property by which the ruffian could be mulcted for his crimes,
the tribunal adjudged him to be scourged with fifty lashes, and
to have his &ldquo;town-fence or stockade destroyed, never to be
rebuilt.&rdquo; The blows were inflicted for the abuse, but the perpetual
demolition of his defensive barrier was in punishment for
refused hospitality. Such is the summary process by which
social virtues are inculcated and enforced among these interior
tribes of Africa!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>It required three days for our refreshed caravan to reach the
dry and precipitous bed of the Sanghu, which I found impossible
to pass with my horse, in consequence of jagged rocks and immense
boulders that covered its channel. But the men were
resolved that my convenient animal should not be left behind.
Accordingly, all hands went to work with alacrity on the trees,
and in a day, they bridged the ravine with logs bound together
by ropes made from twisted bark. Across this frail and swaying
fabric I urged the horse with difficulty; but hardly had he
reached the opposite bank, and recovered from his nervous
tremor, when I was surprised by an evident anxiety in the beast
to return to his swinging pathway. The guides declared it to be
an instinctive warning of danger from wild beasts with which the
region is filled; and, even while we spoke, two of the scouts who
were in advance selecting ground for our camp, returned with the
carcasses of a deer and leopard. Though meat had not passed
our lips for five days, we were in no danger of starvation; the
villages teemed with fruits and vegetables. Pine-apples, bananas,
and a pulpy globe resembling the peach in form and flavor,
quenched our thirst and satisfied our hunger.</p>

<p>Besides these, our greedy natives foraged in the wilderness
for nourishment unknown, or at least unused, by civilized folks.
They found comfort in barks of various trees, as well as in buds,
berries, and roots, some of which they devoured raw, while
others were either boiled or made into palatable decoctions with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
water that gurgled from every hill. The broad valleys and open
country supplied animal and vegetable &ldquo;delicacies&rdquo; which a
white man would pass unnoticed. Many a time, when I was as
hungry as a wolf, I found my vagabonds in a nook of the woods,
luxuriating over a mess with the unctuous lips of aldermen;
but when I came to analyze the stew, I generally found it to
consist of a &ldquo;witch&rsquo;s cauldron,&rdquo; copiously filled with snails,
lizards, iguanas, frogs and alligators!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>A journey to the interior of Africa would be a rural jaunt, were
it not so often endangered by the perils of war. The African
may fairly be characterized as a shepherd, whose pastoral life is
varied by a little agriculture, and the conflicts into which he is
seduced, either by family quarrels, or the natural passions of his
blood. His country, though uncivilized, is not so absolutely
wild as is generally supposed. The gradual extension of Mahometanism
throughout the interior is slowly but evidently modifying
the Negro. An African Mussulman is <i>still</i> a warrior,
for the dissemination of faith as well as for the gratification of
avarice; yet the Prophet&rsquo;s laws are so much more genial than
the precepts of paganism, that, within the last half century, the
humanizing influence of the Koran is acknowledged by all who
are acquainted with the interior tribes.</p>

<p>But in all the changes that may come over the spirit of <i>man</i>
in Africa, her magnificent external <i>nature</i> will for ever remain
the game. A little labor teems with vast returns. The climate
exacts nothing but shade from the sun and shelter from the
storm. Its oppressive heat forbids a toilsome industry, and
almost enforces indolence as a law. With every want supplied,
without the allurements of social rivalry, without the temptations
of national ambition or personal pride, what has the African to
do in his forest of palm and cocoa,&mdash;his grove of orange,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
pomegranate and fig,&mdash;on his mat of comfortable repose, where the
fruit stoops to his lips without a struggle for the prize,&mdash;save to
brood over, or gratify, the electric passions with which his soul
seems charged to bursting!</p>

<p>It is an interesting task to travel through a continent filled
with such people, whose minds are just beginning, here and there,
to emerge from the vilest heathenism, and to glimmer with a
faith that bears wrapped in its unfolded leaves, the seeds of a
modified civilization.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>As I travelled in the &ldquo;dry season,&rdquo; I did not encounter
many of the discomforts that beset the African wayfarer in
periods of rain and tempest. I was not obliged to flounder
through lagoons, or swim against the current of perilous rivers.
We met their traces almost every day; and, in many places, the
soil was worn into parched ravines or the tracks of dried-up
torrents. Whatever affliction I experienced arose from the
wasting depression of heat. We did not suffer from lack of water
or food, for the caravan of the <span class="smcap">Ali-Mami</span> commanded implicit
obedience throughout our journey.</p>

<p>In the six hundred miles I traversed, whilst absent from the
coast, my memory, after twenty-six years, leads me, from beginning
to end, through an almost continuous forest-path. We
struck a trail when we started, and we left it when we came home.
It was rare, indeed, to encounter a cross road, except when it
led to neighboring villages, water, or cultivated fields. So dense
was the forest foliage, that we often walked for hours in shade
without a glimpse of the sun. The emerald light that penetrated
the wood, bathed every thing it touched with mellow refreshment.
But we were repaid for this partial bliss by intense suffering
when we came forth from the sanctuary into the bare
valleys, the arid <i>barrancas</i>, and marshy <i>savannas</i> of an open
region. There, the red eye of the African sun glared with
merciless fervor. Every thing reflected its rays. They struck
us like lances from above, from below, from the sides, from the
rocks, from the fields, from the stunted herbage, from the bushes.
All was glare! Our eyes seemed to simmer in their sockets.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
Whenever the path followed the channel of a brook, whose dried
torrents left bare the scorched and broken rocks, our feet fled
from the ravine as from heated iron. Frequently we entered
extensive <i>prairies</i>, covered with blades of sword-grass, tall as
our heads, whose jagged edges tore us like saws, though we protected
our faces with masks of wattled willows. And yet, after
all these discomforts, how often are my dreams haunted by charming
pictures of natural scenery that have fastened themselves for
ever in my memory!</p>

<p>As the traveller along the coast turns the prow of his canoe
through the surf, and crosses the angry bar that guards the
mouth of an African river, he suddenly finds himself moving
calmly onward between sedgy shores, buried in mangroves. Presently,
the scene expands in the unruffled mirror of a deep, majestic
stream. Its lofty banks are covered by innumerable varieties
of the tallest forest trees, from whoso summits a trailing network
of vines and flowers floats down and sweeps the passing
current. A stranger who beholds this scenery for the first time
is struck by the immense size, the prolific abundance, and gorgeous
verdure of every thing. Leaves, large enough for garments,
lie piled and motionless in the lazy air: The bamboo and
cane shake their slender spears and pennant leaves as the stream
ripples among their roots. Beneath the massive trunks of forest
trees, the country opens; and, in vistas through the wood, the
traveller sees innumerable fields lying fallow in grass, or waving
with harvests of rice and <i>cassava</i>, broken by golden clusters of
Indian corn. Anon, groups of oranges, lemons, coffee-trees,
plantains and bananas, are crossed by the tall stems of cocoas,
and arched by the broad and drooping coronals of royal palm.
Beyond this, capping the summit of a hill, may be seen the conical
huts of natives, bordered by fresh pastures dotted with
flocks of sheep and goats, or covered by numbers of the sleekest
cattle. As you leave the coast, and shoot round the river-curves
of this fragrant wilderness teeming with flowers, vocal
with birds, and gay with their radiant plumage, you plunge into
the interior, where the rising country slowly expands into hills
and mountains.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
The forest is varied. Sometimes it is a matted pile of tree
vine, and bramble, obscuring every thing, and impervious save
with knife and hatchet. At others, it is a Gothic temple. The
sward spreads openly for miles on every side, while, from its even
surface, the trunks of straight and massive trees rise to a prodigious
height, clear from every obstruction, till their gigantic
limbs, like the capitals of columns, mingle their foliage in a roof
of perpetual verdure.</p>

<p>At length the hills are reached, and the lowland heat is tempered
by mountain freshness. The scene that may be beheld
from almost any elevation, is always beautiful, and sometimes
grand. Forest, of course, prevails; yet, with a glass, and often
by the unaided eye, gentle hills, swelling from the wooded landscape,
may be seen covered with native huts, whose neighborhood
is checkered with patches of sward and cultivation, and
inclosed by massive belts of primeval wildness. Such is commonly
the westward view; but north and east, as far as vision
extends, noble outlines of hill and mountain may be traced against
the sky, lapping each other with their mighty folds, until they
fade away in the azure horizon.</p>

<p>When a view like this is beheld at morning, in the neighborhood
of rivers, a dense mist will be observed lying beneath the
spectator in a solid stratum, refracting the light now breaking
from the east. Here and there, in this lake of vapor, the tops
of hills peer up like green islands in a golden sea. But, ere you
have time to let fancy run riot, the &ldquo;cloud compelling&rdquo; orb lifts
its disc over the mountains, and the fogs of the valley, like ghosts
at cock-crow, flit from the dells they have haunted since nightfall.
Presently, the sun is out in his terrible splendor. Africa
unveils to her master, and the blue sky and green forest blaze
and quiver with his beams.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>I felt so much the lack of scenery in my narrative, that I
thought it well to group in a few pages the African pictures I
have given in the last chapter. My story had too much of the
bareness of the Greek stage, and I was conscious that landscape,
as well as action, was required to mellow the subject and relieve
it from tedium. After our dash through the wilderness, let us
return to the slow toil of the caravan.</p>

<p>Four days brought us to Tamisso from our last halt. We
camped on the copious brook that ran near the town-walls, and
while Ali-Ninpha thought proper to compliment the chief, Mohamedoo,
by a formal announcement of our arrival, the caravan
made ready for reception by copious, but <i>needed</i>, ablutions of
flesh and raiment. The women, especially, were careful in adorning
and heightening their charms. Wool was combed to its
utmost rigidity; skins were greased till they shone like polished
ebony; ankles and arms were restrung with beads; and loins
were girded with snowy waist-cloths. Ali-Ninpha knew the pride
of his old Mandingo companions, and was satisfied that Mohamedoo
would have been mortified had we surprised him within
the precincts of his court, squatted, perhaps, on a dirty mat with
a female scratching his head! Ali-Ninpha was a prudent gentleman,
and knew the difference between the private and public
lives of his illustrious countrymen!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
In the afternoon our interpreters returned to camp with Mohamedoo&rsquo;s
son, accompanied by a dozen women carrying platters
of boiled rice, calabashes filled with delicate sauce, and abundance
of <i>ture</i>, or vegetable butter. A beautiful horse was also despatched
for my triumphal entry into town.</p>

<p>The food was swallowed with an appetite corresponding to
our recent penitential fare; the tents were struck; and the caravan
was forthwith advanced towards Tamisso. All the noise we
could conveniently make, by way of <i>music</i>, was, of course, duly
attempted. Interpreters and guides went ahead, discharging
guns. Half a dozen tom-toms were struck with uncommon
rapidity and vigor, while the unctuous women set up a chorus of
melody that would not have disgraced a band of &ldquo;Ethiopian
Minstrels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half-way to the town our turbulent mob was met by a troop
of musicians sent out by the chief to greet us with song and harp.
I was quickly surrounded by the singers, who chanted the most
fulsome praise of the opulent Mongo, while a court-fool or buffoon
insisted on leading my horse, and occasionally wiping my
face with his filthy handkerchief!</p>

<p>Presently we reached the gates, thronged by pressing crowds
of curious burghers. Men, women, and children, had all come
abroad to see the immense <i>Furtoo</i>, or white man, and appeared
as much charmed by the spectacle as if I had been a banished
patriot. I was forced to dismount at the low wicket, but here
the <i>empressement</i> of my inquisitive hosts became so great, that
the &ldquo;nation&rsquo;s guest&rdquo; was forced to pause until some amiable
bailiffs modified the amazement of their fellow-citizens by staves
and whips.</p>

<p>I lost no time in the lull, while relieved from the mob, to
pass onward to &ldquo;the palace&rdquo; of Mohamedoo, which, like all
royal residences in Africa, consisted of a mud-walled quadrangular
inclosure, with a small gate, a large court, and a quantity
of <i>adobe</i> huts, surrounded by shady verandahs. The furniture,
mats, and couches were of cane, while wooden platters, brass kettles,
and common wash-basins, were spread out in every direction
for show and service.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
On a coach, covered with several splendid leopard skins, reclined
Mohamedoo, awaiting my arrival with as much stateliness
as if he had been a scion of civilized royalty. The chief was a
man of sixty at least. His corpulent body was covered with
short Turkish trousers, and a large Mandingo shirt profusely
embroidered with red and yellow worsted. His bald or shaved
head was concealed by a light turban, while a long white beard
stood out in relief against his tawny skin, and hung down upon
his breast. Ali-Ninpha presented me formally to this personage,
who got up, shook hands, &ldquo;snapped fingers,&rdquo; and welcomed me
thrice. My Fullah chief and Mandingo companion then proceeded
to &ldquo;<i>make their dantica</i>,&rdquo; or declare the purpose of
their visit; but when they announced that I was the guest of
the Fullah Ali-Mami, and, accordingly, was <i>entitled</i> to free passage
every where without expense, I saw that the countenance
of the veteran instantly fell, and that his welcome was dashed by
the loss of a heavy duty which he designed exacting for my
transit.</p>

<p>The sharp eye of Ali-Ninpha was not slow in detecting Mohamedoo&rsquo;s
displeasure; and, as I had previously prepared him
in private, he took an early opportunity to whisper in the old
man&rsquo;s ear, that Don T&eacute;odore knew he was compelled to journey
through Tamisso, and, of course, had not come empty-handed.
My object, he said, in visiting this region and the territory of
the Fullah king, was not idle curiosity alone; but that I was
prompted by a desire for liberal trade, and especially for the
purchase of slaves to load the numerous vessels I had lingering
on the coast, with immense cargoes of cloth, muskets, and powder.</p>

<p>The clouds were dispersed as soon as a hint was thrown out
about traffic. The old sinner nodded like a mandarin who knew
what he was about, and, rising as soon as the adroit whisperer
had finished, took me by the hand, and in a loud voice, presented
me to the people as his &ldquo;<i>beloved son</i>!&rdquo; Besides this, the best
house within the royal inclosure was fitted with fresh comforts
for my lodging. When the Fullah chief withdrew from the
audience, Ali-Ninpha brought in the mistress of Mohamedoo&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
harem, who acted as his confidential clerk, and we speedily
handed over the six pieces of cotton and an abundant supply of
tobacco with which I designed to propitiate her lord and master.</p>

<p>Tired of the dust, crowd, heat, confinement and curiosity of
an African town, I was glad to gulp down my supper of broiled
chickens and milk, preparatory to a sleepy attack on my couch
of rushes spread with mats and skins. Yet, before retiring for
the night, I thought it well to refresh my jaded frame by a bath,
which the prince had ordered to be prepared in a small court
behind my chamber. But I grieve to say, that my modesty was
put to a sore trial, when I began to unrobe. Locks and latches
are unknown in this free-and-easy region. It had been noised
abroad among the dames of the harem, that the <i>Furtoo</i> would
probably perform his ablutions before he slept; so that, when I
entered the yard, my tub was surrounded by as many inquisitive
eyes as the dinner table of Louis the Fourteenth, when sovereigns
dined in public. As I could not speak their language, I
made all the pantomimic signs of graceful supplication that commonly
soften the hearts of the sex on the stage, hoping, by dumb-show,
to secure my privacy. But gestures and grimace were
unavailing. I then made hold to take off my shirt, leaving my
nether garments untouched. Hitherto, the dames had seen only
my bronzed face and hands, but when the snowy pallor of my
breast and back was unveiled, many of them fled incontinently,
shouting to their friends to &ldquo;come and see the <i>peeled Furtoo</i>!&rdquo;
An ancient crone, the eldest of the crew, ran her hand roughly
across the fairest portion of my bosom, and looking at her fingers
with disgust, as if I reeked with leprosy, wiped them on
the wall. As displeasure seemed to predominate over admiration,
I hoped this experiment would have satisfied the inquest,
but, as black curiosity exceeds all others, the wenches continued
to linger, chatter, grin and feel, until I was forced to disappoint
their anxiety for further disclosures, by an abrupt &ldquo;good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We tarried in Tamisso three days to recruit, during which I
was liberally entertained on the prince&rsquo;s hospitable mat, where
African stews of relishing flavor, and tender fowls smothered in
snowy rice, regaled me at least twice in every twenty-four hours.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
Mohamedoo fed me with an European silver spoon, which, he
said, came from among the effects of a traveller who, many years
before, died far in the interior. In all his life, he had seen but
<i>four</i> of our race within the walls of Tamisso. Their names
escaped his memory; but the last, he declared, was a poor and
clever youth, probably from Senegal, who followed a powerful
caravan, and &ldquo;read the Koran like a <i>mufti</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tamisso was entirely surrounded by a tall double fence
of pointed posts. The space betwixt the inclosures, which were
about seven feet apart, was thickly planted with smaller spear-headed
staves, hardened by fire. If the first fence was leaped by
assailants, they met a cruel reception from those impaling sentinels.
Three gates afforded admission to different sections of the
town, but the passage through them consisted of zig-zags, with
loopholes cut judiciously in the angles, so as to command every
point of access to the narrow streets of the suburbs.</p>

<p>The parting between Mohamedoo and myself was friendly in
the extreme. Provisions for four days were distributed by the
prince to the caravan, and he promised that my return should be
welcomed by an abundant supply of slaves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>As our caravan approached the Fullah country, and got into the
higher lands, where the air was invigorating, I found its pace
improved so much that we often exceeded twenty miles in our
daily journey. The next important place we were to approach
was Jallica. For three days, our path coasted the southern
edge of a mountain range, whose declivities and valleys were
filled with rivers, brooks, and streamlets, affording abundant
irrigation to fields teeming with vegetable wealth. The population
was dense. Frequent caravans, with cattle and slaves,
passed us on their way to various marts. Our supplies of food
were plentiful. A leaf of tobacco purchased a fowl; a charge
of powder obtained a basin of milk, or a dozen of eggs; and a
large sheep cost only six cents, or a quart of salt.</p>

<p>Five days after quitting Tamisso, our approach to Jallica
was announced; and here, as at our last resting-place, it was
deemed proper to halt half a day for notice and ablution before
entering a city, whose chief&mdash;<span class="smcap">Suphiana</span>&mdash;was a kinsman of Ali-Ninpha.</p>

<p>The distance from our encampment to the town was about
three miles; but an hour had hardly elapsed after our arrival,
when the deep boom of the war-drum gave token that our message
had been received with welcome. I was prepared, in some
measure, for a display of no ordinary character at Jallica, because
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
my Mandingo friend, Ali-Ninpha, inhabited the town in his
youth, and had occupied a position which gave importance to his
name throughout Soolimana. The worthy fellow had been absent
many years from Jallica, and wept like a child when he
heard the sound of the war-drum. Its discordant beat had the
same effect on the savage that the sound of their village bells
has on the spirit of returning wanderers in civilized lands.
When the rattle of the drum was over, he told me that for five
years he controlled that very instrument in Jallica, during which
it had never sounded a retreat or betokened disaster. In peace
it was never touched, save for public rejoicing; and the authorities
allowed it to be beaten <i>now</i> only because an old commander
of the tribe was to be received with the honors due to his rank
and service. Whilst we were still conversing, Suphiana&rsquo;s lance-bearer
made his appearance, and, with a profound <i>salaam</i>, announced
that the &ldquo;gates of Jallica were open to the Mandingo
and his companions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No <i>fanda</i> or refreshments were sent with the welcome; but
when the caravan got within fifty yards of the walls, a band of
shouting warriors marched forth, and lifting Ali-Ninpha on their
shoulders, bore him through the gates, singing war-songs, accompanied
by all sorts of music and hubbub.</p>

<p>I had purposely lingered with my men in the rear of the
great body of Africans, so that nearly the whole caravan passed
the portal before my complexion&mdash;though deeply bronzed by exposure&mdash;made
me known to the crowd as a white man.</p>

<p>Then, instantly, the air rang with the sound of&mdash;&ldquo;Furtoo!
Furtoo! Furtoo!&rdquo;&mdash;and the gate was slammed in our faces,
leaving us completely excluded from guide and companions.
But, in the midst of his exultant reception, Ali-Ninpha did not
forget the Mongo of Kambia. Hardly had he attained the end
of the street, when he heard the cry of exclusion, and observed
the closing portal. By this time, my Fullah friend had wrought
himself into an examplary fit of Oriental rage with the inhospitable
Mandingoes, so that I doubt very much whether he
would not have knocked the dust from his sandals on the gate of
Jallica, had not Ali-Ninpha rushed through the wicket, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
commanding the portal to be reopened, apologized contritely to
the Mahometan and myself.</p>

<p>This unfortunate mistake, or accident, not only caused considerable
delay, but rather dampened the delight of our party
as it defiled in the spacious square of Jallica, and entered the
open shed which was called a &ldquo;<i>palaver-house</i>.&rdquo; Its vast area
was densely packed with a fragrant crowd of old and young,
armed with muskets or spears. All wore knives or cutlasses,
slung by a belt high up on their necks; while, in their midst surrounded
by a court of veterans, stood Suphiana, the prince, waiting
our arrival.</p>

<p>In front marched Ali-Ninpha, preceded by a numerous band
of shrieking and twanging minstrels. As he entered the apartment,
Suphiana arose, drew his sword, and embracing the stranger
with his left arm, waved the shining blade over his head,
with the other. This peculiar <i>accolade</i> was imitated by each
member of the royal council; while, in the centre of the square,
the war-drum,&mdash;a hollowed tree, four feet in diameter, covered
with hides,&mdash;was beaten by two savages with slung-shot, until its
thundering reverberations completely deafened us.</p>

<p>You may imagine my joy and comfort when I saw the Mandingo
take a seat near the prince, as a signal for the din&rsquo;s cessation.
This, however, was only the commencement of another
prolonged ceremonial; for now began the royal review and salute
in honor of the returned commander. During two hours, an uninterrupted
procession of all the warriors, chiefs, and head-men
of Jallica, defiled in front of the ancient drum-major; and, as
each approached, he made his obeisance by pointing a spear or
weapon at my landlord&rsquo;s feet. During this I remained on horseback
without notice or relief from the authorities. Ali-Ninpha,
however, saw my impatient discomfort, and once or twice despatched
a sly message to preserve my good humor. The ceremony
was one of absolute compulsion, and could not be avoided
without discourtesy to the prince and his countrymen. As soon
as he could escape, however, he hastened over the court-yard to
assist me in dismounting; and dashing the rude crowd right and
left, led me to his kinsman Suphiana. The prince extended his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
royal hand in token of amity; Ali-Ninpha declared me to be
his &ldquo;son;&rdquo; while the long string of compliments and panegyrics
he pronounced upon my personal qualities, moral virtues, and
<i>wealth</i>, brought down a roar of grunts by way of applause from
the toad-eating courtiers.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Jallica was a fairer town than any I had hitherto encountered
in my travels. Its streets were wider, its houses better, its
people more civil. No one intruded on the friend of Ali-Ninpha,
and guest of Suphiana. I bathed without visits from inquisitive
females. My house was my castle; and, when I stirred abroad,
two men preceded me with rattans to keep my path clear from
women and children.</p>

<p>After lounging about quietly for a couple of days, wearing
away fatigue, and getting rid of the stains of travel, I thought
it advisable to drop in one morning, unannounced, after breakfast,
at Suphiana&rsquo;s with the presents that are customary in the
east. As the guest,&mdash;during my whole journey,&mdash;of the Ali-Mami,
or King of Footha-Yallon, I was entirely exempt by customary
law from this species of tax, nor would my Fullah protector
have allowed me to offer a tribute had he known it;&mdash;yet,
I always took a secret opportunity to present a <i>voluntary gift</i>,
for I wished my memory to smell sweet along my track in Africa.
Suphiana fully appreciated my generosity under the circumstances,
and returned the civility by an invitation to dinner
at the house of his principal wife. When the savory feast
with which he regaled me was over, female singers were introduced
for a concert. Their harps were triangles of wood, corded
with fibres of cane; their banjoes consisted of gourds covered
with skin pierced by holes, and strung like the harps; but, I
confess, that I can neither rave nor go into ecstasies over the combined
effect which saluted me from such instruments or such
voices. I was particularly struck, however, by one of their inventions,
which slightly resembles the <i>harmonica</i> I have seen
played by children in this country. A board, about two feet
square, was bordered by a light frame at two ends, across which
a couple of cane strings were tightly stretched. On these, strips
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
of nicely trimmed bamboo, gradually diminishing in size from
left to right, were placed; whilst beneath them, seven gourds,
also gradually decreasing, were securely fastened to mellow the
sound. The instrument was carried by a strap round the player&rsquo;s
neck, and was struck by two small wooden hammers softened by
some delicate substance.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest girls in the bevy had charge of this
African piano, and was said to be renowned for uncommon skill.
Her feet, hands, wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees, were strung
with small silvery bells; and, as the gay damsel was dancer and
singer as well as musician, she seemed to reek with sound from
every pore. Many of her attitudes would probably have been,
at least, more picturesque and decent for drapery; but, in Jallica,
<span class="smcap">Madoo</span>, the <i>ayah</i>, was considered a Mozart in composition,
a Lind in melody, and a Taglioni on the &ldquo;light fantastic
toe!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the performance closed, Suphiana presented her a
slave; and, as she made an obeisance to me in passing, I handed
her my <i>bowie-knife</i>, promising to redeem it at my lodgings with
<i>ten pounds of tobacco</i>!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Some superstitious notions about the state of the moon prevented
my Fullah guide from departing as soon as I desired;
but while we were dallying with the planet, Ali-Ninpha became
so ill that he was compelled to halt and end the journey in his
favorite Jallica. I rather suspected the Mandingo to feign
more suffering than he really experienced, and I soon discovered
that his malady was nothing but a sham. In truth, Ali-Ninpha
had duped so many Fullah traders on the beach, and
owed them the value of so many slaves, that he found it extremely
inconvenient; if not perilous, to enter the domain of the <span class="smcap">Ali-Mami
of Footha-Yallon</span>!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>A messenger was despatched from Jallica, in advance of our
departure, to announce our approach to Timbo. For six days
more, our path led over hill and dale, and through charming
valleys, fed by gentle streamlets that nourished the vigorous
vegetation of a mountain land.</p>

<p>As we crossed the last summits that overlooked the territory
of Footha-Yallon, a broad <i>plateau</i>, whence a wide range of country
might be beheld, was filled with bands of armed men, afoot
and on horseback, while a dozen animals were held in tether by
their gayly dressed attendants. I dashed to the head of the
caravan on my jaded beast, and reached it just in time to
find the sable arms of Ahmah-de-Bellah opening to greet me!
The generous youth, surrounded by his friends and escorted by
a select corps of soldiers and slaves, had come thus far on the
path to offer the prince&rsquo;s welcome!</p>

<p>I greeted the Mahometan with the fervor of ancient love;
and, in a moment, we were all dismounted and on our knees;
while, at a signal from the chief, profound silence reigned
throughout the troop and caravan. Every eye was turned across
the distant plain to the east. An air of profoundest devotion
subdued the multitude, and, in a loud chant, Ahmah-de-Bellah,
with outstretched arms and upraised face, sang forth a
psalm of gratitude to Allah for the safety of his &ldquo;brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
The surprise of this complimentary reception was not only
delightful as an evidence of African character among these more
civilized tribes of the Mahometan interior, but it gave me an
assurance of security and trade, which was very acceptable to one
so far within the bowels of the land. We were still a day&rsquo;s
journey from the capital. Ahmah-de-Bellah declared it impossible,
with all the diligence we could muster, to reach Timbo
without another halt. Nevertheless, as he was extremely solicitous
to bring us to our travel&rsquo;s end, he not only supplied my personal
attendants with fresh horses, but ordered carriers from
his own guard to charge themselves with the entire luggage of
our caravan.</p>

<p>Thus relieved of burden, our party set forth on the path in
a brisk trot, and resting after dark for several hours in a village,
we entered Timbo unceremoniously before daybreak while its
inhabitants were still asleep.</p>

<p>I was immediately conducted to a house specially built for
me, surrounded by a high wall to protect my privacy from intrusion.
Within, I found a careful duplicate of all the humble
comforts in my domicil on the Rio Pongo. Tables, sofas, plates,
knives, forks, tumblers, pitchers, basins,&mdash;had all been purchased
by my friend, and forwarded for this establishment, from other
factories without my knowledge; while the centre of the main
apartment was decorated with an &ldquo;American rocking-chair,&rdquo;
which the natives had ingeniously contrived of rattans and bamboo!
Such pleasant evidences of refined attention were more
remarkable and delicate, because most of the articles are not
used by Mahometans. &ldquo;These, I hope,&rdquo; said Ahmah-de-Bellah,
as he led me to a seat, &ldquo;will make you comparatively comfortable
while you please to dwell with your brother in Timbo.
You have no thanks to return, because I have not treated you
like a <i>native</i> Mussulman; for you were kind enough to remember
all my own little nationalities when I was your guest on the
beach. <span class="smcap">Allah</span> be praised for your redemption and arrival;&mdash;and
so, brother, take your rest in peace within the realm of the Ali-Mami,
your father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I embraced the generous fellow with as much cordiality as if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
he had been a kinsman from the sweet valley of Arno. During his
visit to my factory he was particularly charmed with an old
dressing-gown I used for my siestas, and when I resolved on this
journey, I caused an improved copy of it to be made by one of
the most skilful artists on the river. A flashy pattern of calico
was duly cut into rather ampler form than is usual among our
dandies. This was charmingly lined with sky-blue, and set off
at the edges with broad bands of glaring yellow. The effect of
the whole, indeed, was calculated to strike an African fancy; so
that, when I drew the garment from my luggage, and threw it,
together with a fine white ruffled shirt, over the shoulders of
&ldquo;my brother,&rdquo; I thought the pious Mussulman would have gone
wild with delight. He hugged me a dozen times with the
gripe of a tiger, and probably would have kissed quite as
lustily, had I not deprecated any further ebullitions of bodily
gratitude.</p>

<p>A bath erased not only the dust of travel from my limbs, but
seemed to extract even the memory of its toils from my bones
and muscles. Ahmah-de-Bellah intimated that the Ali-Mami
would soon be prepared to receive me without ceremony. The
old gentleman was confined by dropsy in his lower extremities,
and probably found it uncomfortable to sustain the annoyance of
public life except when absolutely necessary. The burden of
my entertainment and glorification, therefore, was cast on the
shoulders of his younger kinsfolk, for which, I confess, I was
proportionally grateful. Accordingly, when I felt perfectly refreshed,
I arose from my matted sofa, and dressing for the first time
in more than a month in a perfectly clean suit, I donned a snowy
shirt, a pair of dashing drills, Parisian pumps, and a Turkish
<i>fez</i>, tipped with a copious tassel. Our interpreters were clad in
fresh Mandingo dresses adorned with extra embroidery. My
body-servant was ordered to appear in a cast-off suit of my own;
so that, when I gave one my double-barrelled gun to carry, and
armed the others with my pistols, and a glittering regulation-sword,&mdash;designed
as a gift for the Ali-Mami,&mdash;I presented a
very respectable and picturesque appearance for a gentleman
abroad on his travels in the East. The moment I issued with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
my train from the house, a crowd of Fullahs was ready to receive
me with exclamations of chattering surprise; still I was
not annoyed, as elsewhere, by the unfailing concourse that followed
my footsteps or clogged my pathway.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;palace&rdquo; of the Ali-Mami of Footha-Yallon, like all
African palaces in this region, was an <i>adobe</i> hovel, surrounded
by its portico shed, and protected by a wall from the intrusion
of the common herd. In front of the dwelling, beneath the
shelter of the verandah, on a fleecy pile of sheepskin mats, reclined
the veteran, whose swollen and naked feet were undergoing
a cooling process from the palm-leaf fans of female slaves.
I marched up boldly in front of him with my military <i>suite</i>, and,
making a profound <i>salaam</i>, was presented by Ahmah-de-Bellah
as his &ldquo;white brother.&rdquo; The Ali at once extended both hands,
and, grasping mine, drew me beside him on the sheepskin.
Then, looking intently over my face and into the very depth
of my eyes, he asked gently with a smile&mdash;&ldquo;what was my
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Ahmah-de-Bellah</span>!&rdquo; replied I, after the fashion of the
country. As I uttered the Mahometan appellation, for which I
had exchanged my own with his son at Kambia, the old man,
who still held my hands, put one of his arms round my waist,
and pressed me still closer to his side;&mdash;then, lifting both arms
extended to heaven, he repeated several times,&mdash;&ldquo;God is great!
God is great! God is great!&mdash;and Mahomet is his Prophet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was followed by a grand inquest in regard to myself
and history. Who was my father? Who was my mother?
How many brothers had I? Were they warriors? Were they
&ldquo;book-men?&rdquo; Why did I travel so far? What delay would
I make in Footha-Yallon? Was my dwelling comfortable?
Had I been treated with honor, respect and attention on my
journey? And, last of all, the prince sincerely hoped that I
would find it convenient to dwell with him during the whole of
the &ldquo;rainy season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several times, in the midst of these interrogations, the patriarch
groaned, and I could perceive, from the pain that flitted
like a shadow over the nerves and muscles of his face, that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
was suffering severely, and, of course, I cut the interview as short
as oriental etiquette would allow. He pressed me once more to
his bosom, and speaking to the interpreter, bade him tell his
master, the Furtoo, that any thing I fancied in the realm was
mine. Slaves, horses, cattle, stuffs,&mdash;all were at my disposal.
Then, pointing to his son, he said: &ldquo;Ahmah-de-Bellah, the white
man is our guest; his brother will take heed for his wants, and
redress every complaint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince was a man of sixty at least. His stature was
noble and commanding, if not absolutely gigantic,&mdash;<i>being several
inches over six feet</i>,&mdash;while his limbs and bulk were in perfect
proportion. His oval head, of a rich mahogany color, was
quite bald to the temples, and covered by a turban, whose
ends depended in twin folds along his cheeks. The contour of
his features was remarkably regular, though his lips were rather
full, and his nose somewhat flat, yet free from the disgusting
depression and cavities of the negro race. His forehead was
high and perpendicular, while his mouth glistened with ivory
when he spoke or smiled. I had frequent opportunities to talk
with the king afterwards, and was always delighted by the affectionate
simplicity of his demeanor. As it was the country&rsquo;s custom
to educate the first-born of royalty for the throne, the Ali-Mami
of Footha-Yallon had been brought up almost within the
precincts of the mosque. I found the prince, therefore, more of
a meditative &ldquo;book-man&rdquo; than warrior; while the rest of his
family, and especially his younger brothers, had never been
exempt from military duties, at home or abroad. Like a good
Mussulman, the sovereign was a quiet, temperate gentleman,
never indulging in &ldquo;bitters&rdquo; or any thing stronger than a drink
fermented from certain roots, and sweetened to resemble <i>mead</i>.
His intercourse with me was always affable and solicitous for my
comfort; nor did he utter half a dozen sentences without interlarding
them with fluent quotations from the Koran. Sometimes,
in the midst of a pleasant chat in which he was wondering
at my curiosity and taste for information about new lands, he
would suddenly break off because it was his hour for prayer; at
others, he would end the interview quite as unceremoniously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
because it was time for ablution. Thus, between praying, washing,
eating, sleeping, slave-dealing, and fanning his dropsical
feet, the life of the Ali-Mami passed monotonously enough even
for an oriental prince; but I doubt not, the same childish routine
is still religiously pursued, unless it has pleased Allah to summon
the faithful prince to the paradise of &ldquo;true believers.&rdquo; I
could never make him understand how a ship might be built
large enough to hold provisions for a six months&rsquo; voyage; and,
as to the <i>sea</i>, &ldquo;it was a mystery that none but God and a white
man could solve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As I was to breakfast on the day of my arrival at the dwelling
of Ahmah-de-Bellah&rsquo;s mother, after my presentation to the
prince her husband, I urged the footsteps of my companion with
no little impatience as soon as I got out of the royal hearing.
My fast had been rather longer than comfortable, even in obedience
to royal etiquette. However, we were soon within the
court-yard of her sable ladyship, who, though a dame of fifty at
least, persisted in hiding her charms of face and bosom beneath
a capacious cloth. Nevertheless, she welcomed me quite tenderly.
She called me &ldquo;Ahmah-de-Bellah-Theodoree,&rdquo;&mdash;and,
with her own hands, mixed the dainties on which we were to
breakfast while cosily squatted on the mats of her verandah.
Our food was simple enough for the most dyspeptic hom&oelig;opathist.
Milk and rice were alternated with bonney-clabber and
honey, seasoned by frequent words of hospitable encouragement.
The frugal repast was washed down by calabashes of cool water,
which were handed round by naked damsels, whose beautiful
limbs might have served as models for an artist.</p>

<p>When the meal was finished, I hoped that the day&rsquo;s ceremonial
was over, but, to my dismay, I discovered that the most
formal portion of my reception was yet to come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will now hasten,&rdquo; said Ahmah-de-Bellah, as I <i>salaamed</i>
his mamma, &ldquo;to the palaver-ground, where I am sure our chiefs
are, by this time, impatient to see you.&rdquo; Had I been a feeble
instead of a robust campaigner, I would not have resisted the
intimation, or desired a postponement of the &ldquo;palaver;&rdquo; so I
&ldquo;took my brother&rsquo;s&rdquo; arm, and, followed by my <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
proceeded to the interview that was to take place beyond the walls,
in an exquisite grove of cotton-wood and tamarind-trees, appropriated
to this sort of town-meeting. Here I found a vast assemblage
of burghers; and in their midst, squatted on sheepskins,
was a select ring of <i>patres conscripti</i>, presided by Sulimani-Ali,
son of the king, and brother of my companion.</p>

<p>As the Fullah presented me to his warrior-kinsman, he rose
with a profound salutation, and taking my hand, led me to a
rock, covered with a white napkin,&mdash;the seat of honor for an
eminent stranger. The moment I was placed, the chiefs sprang
up and each one grasped my hand, bidding me welcome <i>thrice</i>.
Ahmah-de-Bellah stood patiently beside me until this ceremony
was over, and each noble resumed his sheepskin. Then, taking
a long cane from the eldest of the group, he stepped forward,
saluted the assembly three times, thrice invoked Allah, and introduced
me to the chiefs and multitude as his &ldquo;brother.&rdquo; I
came, he said, to Footha-Yallon on his invitation, and by the express
consent of his beloved king and father, and of his beloved
elder brother, Sulimani. He hoped, therefore, that every
&ldquo;head-man&rdquo; present would see the rites of hospitality faithfully
exercised to his white brother while he dwelt in Footha. There
were many reasons that he could give why this should be done;
but he would rest content with stating only three. First of all:
I was nearly as good a Mussulman as many Mandingoes, and he
knew the fact, because <i>he had converted me himself</i>! Secondly:
I was entitled to every sort of courtesy from Fullahs, because I
was a <i>rich</i> trader from the Rio Pongo. And, thirdly: I had
penetrated even to this very heart of Africa to purchase slaves
for most liberal prices.</p>

<p>It is the custom in African &ldquo;palavers,&rdquo; as well as among
African religionists, to give token of assent by a sigh, a groan,
a slight exclamation, or a shout, when any thing affecting, agreeable,
or touching is uttered by a speaker. Now, when my Fullah
brother informed his friends of my arrival, my name, my
demand for hospitality, and my wealth, the grunts and groans of
the assembly augmented in number and volume as he went on;
but when they heard of my design &ldquo;to purchase <i>slaves</i>&rdquo; a climax
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
was reached at once, and, as with one voice, they shouted,
&ldquo;May the Lord of heaven be praised!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I smothered a laugh and strangled a smile as well as I could,
when my interpreters expounded the &ldquo;stump speech&rdquo; of Ahmah-de-Bellah;
and I lost no time in directing them to display the
presents which some of my retainers, in the meanwhile, had
brought to the grove. They consisted of several packages of
blue and white calicoes, ten yards of brilliant scarlet cloth, six
kegs of powder, three hundred pounds of tobacco, two strings
of amber beads, and six muskets. On a beautiful rug, I set aside
the gilded sword and <i>a package of cantharides</i>, designed for the
king.</p>

<p>When my arrangement was over, Sulimani took the cane from
his brother, and stepping forward, said that the gifts to which he
pointed proved the truth of Ahmah-de-Bellah&rsquo;s words, and that
a rich man, indeed, had come to Footha-Yallon. Nay, more;&mdash;the
rich man wanted slaves! Was I not generous? I was their
guest, and owed them no tribute or duties; and yet, had I not
<i>voluntarily</i> lavished my presents upon the chiefs? Next day,
his father would personally distribute my offering; but, whilst I
dwelt in Footha, a bullock and ten baskets of rice should daily be
furnished for my caravan&rsquo;s support; and, as every chief would
partake my bounty, each one should contribute to my comfort.</p>

<p>This speech, like the former, was hailed with grunts; but I
could not help noticing that the vote of supplies was not cheered
half as lustily as the announcement of my <i>largesse</i>.</p>

<p>The formalities being over, the inquisitive head-men crowded
round the presents with as much eagerness as aspirants for office
at a presidential inauguration. The merchandise was inspected,
felt, smelled, counted, measured, and set aside. The rug and
the sword, being royal gifts, were delicately handled. But when
the vials of cantharides were unpacked, and their contents announced,
each of the chieftains insisted that his majesty should
not monopolize the coveted stimulant. A sharp dispute on the
subject arose between the princes and the councillors, so that I
was forced to interfere through the interpreters, who could only
quiet the rebels by the promise of a dozen additional flasks for
their private account.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
In the midst of the wrangling, Sulimani and Ahmah ordered
their father&rsquo;s slaves to carry the gifts to the Ali-Mami&rsquo;s palace;
and, taking me between them, we marched, arm in arm, to my
domicil. Here I found Abdulmomen-Ali, another son of the
king, waiting for his brothers to present him to the Mongo of
Kambia. Abdulmomen was introduced as &ldquo;a learned divine,&rdquo;
and began at once to talk Koran in the most <i>mufti</i>-like manner.
I had made such sorry improvement in Mahometanism since
Ahmah-de-Bellah&rsquo;s departure from the Rio Pongo, that I thought
it safest to sit silent, as if under the deepest fervor of Mussulman
conviction. I soon found that Abdulmomen, like many
more clergymen, was willing enough to do all the preaching,
whenever he found an unresisting listener. I put on a look of
very intelligent assent and thankfulness to all the arguments
and commentaries of my black brother, and in this way I avoided
the detection of my ignorance, as many a better man has probably
done before me!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p>Timbo lies on a rolling plain. North of it, a lofty mountain
range rises at the distance of ten or fifteen miles, and sweeps
eastwardly to the horizon. The landscape, which declines from
these slopes to the south, is in many places bare; yet fields of
plentiful cultivation, groves of cotton-wood, tamarind and oak,
thickets of shrubbery and frequent villages, stud its surface, and
impart an air of rural comfort to the picturesque scene.</p>

<p>I soon proposed a gallop with my African kindred over the
neighborhood; and, one fine morning, after a plentiful breakfast
of stewed fowls, boiled to rags with rice, and seasoned with
delicious &ldquo;palavra sauce,&rdquo; we cantered off to the distant villages.
As we approached the first brook, but before the fringe of screening
bushes was passed, our cavalcade drew rein abruptly, while
Ahmah-de-Bellah cried out: &ldquo;Strangers are coming!&rdquo; A few
moments after, as we slowly crossed the stream, I noticed several
women crouched in the underwood, having fled from the bath.
This warning is universally given, and enforced by law, to guard
the modesty of the gentler sex.</p>

<p>In half an hour we reached the first suburban village; but
fame had preceded us with my character, and as the settlement
was cultivated either by serfs or negroes liable to be made so,
we found the houses bare. The poor wretches had learned, on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
the day of my reception, that the principal object of my journey
was to obtain slaves, and, of course, they imagined that the only
object of my foray in their neighborhood, was to seize the gang
and bear it abroad in bondage. Accordingly, we tarried only a
few minutes in Findo, and dashed off to Furo; but here, too,
the blacks had been panic struck, and escaped so hurriedly that
they left their pots of rice, vegetables, and meat boiling in their
sheds. Furo was absolutely stripped of inhabitants; the veteran
chief of the village did not even remain to do the honors
for his affrighted brethren. Ahmah-de-Bellah laughed heartily
at the terror I inspired; but I confess I could not help feeling
sadly mortified when I found my presence shunned as a pestilence.</p>

<p>The native villages through which I passed on this excursion
manifested the great comfort in which these Africans live throughout
their prolific land, when unassailed by the desolating wars
that are kept up for slave-trade. It was the height of the dry
season, when every thing was parched by the sun, yet I could
trace the outlines of fine plantations, gardens, and rice-fields.
Every where I found abundance of peppers, onions, garlic, tomatoes,
sweet potatoes, and cassava; while tasteful fences were
garlanded with immense vines and flowers. Fowls, goats, sheep,
and oxen, stalked about in innumerable flocks, and from every
domicil depended a paper, inscribed with a charm from the Koran
to keep off thieves and witches.</p>

<p>My walks through Timbo were promoted by the constant
efforts of my entertainers to shield me from intrusive curiosity.
Whenever I sallied forth, two townsfolk in authority were sent
forward to warn the public that the Furtoo desired to promenade
without a mob at his heels. These lusty criers stationed themselves
at the corners with an iron triangle, which they rattled to
call attention to the king&rsquo;s command; and, in a short time, the
highways were so clear of people, who feared a <i>bastinado</i>, that I
found my loneliness rather disagreeable than otherwise. <i>Every
person I saw, shunned me.</i> When I called the children or
little girls,&mdash;they fled from me. My reputation as a slaver in
the villages, and the fear of a lash in the town, furnished me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
much more solitude than is generally agreeable to a sensitive
traveller.</p>

<p>Towards nightfall I left my companions, and wrapping myself
closely in a Mandingo dress, stole away through bye-ways
to a brook which runs by the town-walls. Thither the females
resort at sunset to draw water; and, choosing a screened situation,
where I would not be easily observed, I watched, for
more than an hour, the graceful children, girls, and women of
Timbo, as they performed this domestic task of eastern lands.</p>

<p>I was particularly impressed by the general beauty of the
sex, who, in many respects, resembled the Moor rather than the
negro. Unaware of a stranger&rsquo;s presence, they came forth as
usual in a simple dress which covers their body from waist to
knee, and leaves the rest of the figure entirely naked. Group
after group gathered together on the brink of the brook in the
slanting sunlight and lengthening shadows of the plain. Some
rested on their pitchers and water vessels; some chatted, or
leaned on each other gracefully, listening to the chat of friends;
some stooped to fill their jars; others lifted the brimming
vessels to their sisters&rsquo; shoulders&mdash;while others strode homeward
singing, with their charged utensils poised on head or
hand. Their slow, stately, swinging movement under the burden,
was grace that might be envied on a Spanish <i>paseo</i>. I do not
think the forms of these Fullah girls,&mdash;with their complexions of
freshest bronze,&mdash;are exceeded in symmetry by the women of any
other country. There was a slender delicacy of limb, waist, neck,
hand, foot, and bosom, which seemed to be the type that moulded
every one of them. I saw none of the hanging breast; the
flat, expanded nostrils; the swollen lips, and fillet-like foreheads,
that characterize the Soosoos and their sisters of the coast. None
were deformed, nor were any marked by traces of disease.
I may observe, moreover, that the male Fullahs of Timbo are
impressed on my memory by a beauty of form, which almost
equals that of the women; and, in fact, the only fault I found
with them was their minute resemblance to the feminine delicacy
of the other sex. They made up, however, in courage
what they lacked in form, for their manly spirit has made them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
renowned among all the tribes they have so long controlled by
distinguished bravery and perseverance.</p>

<p>The patriarchal landscape by the brook, with the Oriental
girls over their water-jars, and the lowing cattle in the pastures,
brought freshly to my mind many a Bible scene I heard my
mother read when I was a boy at home; and I do not know
what revolution might have been wrought on my spirit had I not
suddenly become critical! A stately dame passed within twenty
feet of my thicket, whose <i>coiffure</i> excited my mirth so powerfully
that I might have been detected as a spy, had not a bitten
lip controlled my laughter. Her ladyship belonged, perhaps, to
the &ldquo;upper-ten&rdquo; of Timbo, whose heads had hitherto been hidden
from my eyes by the jealous <i>yashmacks</i> they constantly
wear in a stranger&rsquo;s presence. In this instance, however, the
woman&rsquo;s head, like that of the younger girls, was uncovered, so
that I had a full view of the stately preparation. Her lower
limbs were clad in ample folds of blue and white cotton, knotted
in an immense mass at the waist, while her long crisp hair had
been combed out to its fullest dimensions and spliced with additional
wool. The ebony fleece was then separated in strands
half an inch in diameter, and plaited all over her skull in a
countless number of distinct braids. This quill-like structure
was then adorned with amber beads, and copiously anointed
with vegetable butter, so that the points gleamed with fire in the
setting sunlight, and made her look as if she had donned for
a bewitching headdress a porcupine instead of a &ldquo;bird of paradise.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>My trip to Timbo, I confess, was one of business rather than
pleasure or scientific exploration. I did not make a record, at
the moment, of my &ldquo;impressions de voyage,&rdquo; and never thought
that, a quarter of a century afterwards, I would feel disposed to
chronicle the journey in a book, as an interesting <i>souvenir</i> of
my early life. Had I supposed that the day would come when
I was to turn author, it is likely I might have been more inquisitive;
but, being only &ldquo;a slaver,&rdquo; I found Ahmah, Sulimani,
Abdulmomen, the Ali-Mami, and all the quality and amusements
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
of Timbo, dull enough, <i>when my object was achieved</i>. Still,
while I was there, I thought I might as well see all that was
visible. I strolled repeatedly through the town. I became excessively
familiar with its narrow streets, low houses, mud walls,
cul-de-sacs, and mosques. I saw no fine bazaars, market-places,
or shops. The chief wants of life were supplied by peddlers.
Platters, jars, and baskets of fruit, vegetables, and meat, were
borne around twice or thrice daily. Horsemen dashed about on
beautiful steeds towards the fields in the morning, or came home
at nightfall at a slower pace. <i>I never saw man or woman bask
lazily in the sun.</i> Females were constantly busy over their
cotton and spinning wheels when not engaged in household occupations;
and often have I seen an elderly dame quietly crouched
in her hovel at sunset reading the Koran. Nor are the men of
Timbo less thrifty. Their city wall is said to hem in about ten
thousand individuals, representing all the social industries.
They weave cotton, work in leather, fabricate iron from the bar,
engage diligently in agriculture, and, whenever not laboriously
employed, devote themselves to reading and writing, of which
they are excessively fond.</p>

<p>These are the faint sketches, which, on ransacking my brain,
I find resting on its tablets. But I was tired of Timbo; I was
perfectly refreshed from my journey; and I was anxious to return
to my factory on the beach. Two &ldquo;moons&rdquo; only had been
originally set apart for the enterprise, and the third was already
waxing towards its full. I feared the Ali-Mami was not yet
prepared with <i>slaves</i> for my departure, and I dreaded lest objections
might be made if I approached his royal highness with the
flat announcement. Accordingly, I schooled my interpreters,
and visited that important personage. I made a long speech, as
full of compliments and blarney as a Christmas pudding is
of plums, and concluded by touching the soft part in African
royalty&rsquo;s heart&mdash;<i>slaves!</i> I told the king that a vessel or two,
with abundant freights, would be waiting me on the river, and
that I must hasten thither with his choicest gangs if he hoped to
reap a profit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
The king and the royal family were no doubt excessively
grieved to part with the Furtoo Mongo, but they were discreet
persons and &ldquo;listened to reason.&rdquo; War parties and scouts were
forthwith despatched to blockade the paths, while press-gangs
made recruits among the villages, and even in Timbo. Sulimani-Ali,
himself, sallied forth, before daybreak, with a troop of horse,
and at sundown, came back with forty-five splendid fellows, captured
in Findo and Furo!</p>

<p>The personal dread of me in the town itself, was augmented.
If I had been a Pestilence before, I was Death now! When I
took my usual morning walk the children ran from me screaming.
Since the arrival of Sulimani with his victims, all who
were under the yoke thought their hour of exile had come. The
poor regarded me as the devil incarnate. Once or twice, I
caught women throwing a handful of dust or ashes towards
me, and uttering an invocation from the Koran to avert the
demon or save them from his clutches. Their curiosity was
merged in terror. <i>My popularity was over!</i></p>

<p>It was not a little amusing that in the midst of the general
dismay, caused by the court of Timbo and myself, my colored
brother Ahmah-de-Bellah, and his kinsman Abdulmomen, lost
no chance of lecturing me about my soul! We kidnapped the
Africans all day and spouted Islamism all night! Our religion,
however, was more speculative than practical. It was much more
important, they thought, that we should embrace the faith of
their peculiar theology, than that we should trouble ourselves
about human rights that interfered with profits and pockets.
We spared Mahometans and enslaved <i>only</i> &ldquo;<i>the heathen</i>;&rdquo;
so that, in fact, we were merely obedient to the behests of Mahomet
when we subdued &ldquo;the infidel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This process of proselytism, however, was not altogether successful.
As I was already a rather poor Christian, I fear that
the Fullah did not succeed in making me a very good Mussulman.
Still, I managed to amuse him with the hope of my <i>future</i>
improvement in his creed, so that we were very good friends
when the Ali-Mami summoned us for a final interview.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
The parting of men is seldom a maudlin affair. The king&rsquo;s
relations presented me bullocks, cows, goats, and sheep. His
majesty sent me five slaves. Sulimani-Ali offered a splendid
white charger. The king&rsquo;s wife supplied me with an African
quilt ingeniously woven of red and yellow threads unravelled
from Manchester cottons; while Ahmah-de-Bellah, like a gentleman
of taste, despatched for my consolation, the two prettiest
handmaidens he could buy or steal in Timbo!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>


<p>I shall not weary the reader with a narrative of my journey
homeward over the track I had followed on my way to Timbo.
A grand Mahometan service was performed at my departure, and
Ahmah-de-Bellah accompanied me as far as Jallica, whence he
was recalled by his father in consequence of a serious family dispute
that required his presence. Ali-Ninpha was prepared, in
this place, to greet me with a welcome, and a copious supply of
gold, wax, ivory, and slaves. At Tamisso, the worthy Mohamedoo
had complied with his promise to furnish a similar addition
to the caravan; so that when we set out for Kya, our troop was
swelled to near a thousand strong, counting men, women, children
and ragamuffins.</p>

<p>At Kya I could not help tarrying four days with my jolly
friend Ibrahim, who received the tobacco, charged with &ldquo;bitters,&rdquo;
during my absence, and was delighted to furnish a nourishing
drop after my long abstinence. As we approached the coast,
another halt was called at a favorable encampment, where Ali-Ninpha
divided the caravan in four parts, reserving the best
portion of slaves and merchandise for me. The division, before
arrival, was absolutely necessary, in order to prevent disputes or
disastrous quarrels in regard to the merchantable quality of
negroes on the beach.</p>

<p>I hoped to take my people by surprise at Kambia; but when
the factory came in sight from the hill-tops back of the settlement,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
I saw the Spanish flag floating from its summit, and heard
the cannon booming forth a welcome to the wanderer. Every
thing had been admirably conducted in my absence. The Fullah
and my clerk preserved their social relations and the public tranquillity
unimpaired. My factory and warehouse were as neat and
orderly as when I left them, so that I had nothing to do but go
to sleep as if I had made a day&rsquo;s excursion to a neighboring village.</p>

<p>Within a week I paid for the caravan&rsquo;s produce, despatched
Mami-de-Yong, and made arrangements with the captain of a
slaver in the river for the remainder of his merchandise. But
the Fullah chief had not left me more than a day or two, when I
was surprised by a traveller who dashed into my factory, with a
message from Ahmah-de-Bellah at Timbo, whence he had posted
in twenty-one days.</p>

<p>Ahmah was in trouble. He had been recalled, as I said,
from Jallica by family quarrels. When he reached the paternal
mat, he found his sister Beeljie bound hand and foot in prison,
with orders for her prompt transportation to my factory as a
slave. These were the irrevocable commands of his royal father,
and of her half-brother, Sulimani. All his appeals, seconded
by those of his mother, were unheeded. She must be <i>shipped</i>
from the Rio Pongo; and no one could be trusted with the task
but the Ali-Mami&rsquo;s son and friend, the Mongo T&eacute;odor!</p>

<p>To resist this dire command, Ahmah charged the messenger
to appeal to my heart by our brotherly love <i>not</i> to allow the
maiden to be sent over sea; but, by force or stratagem, to retain
her until he arrived on the beach.</p>

<p>The news amazed me. I knew that African Mahometans
never sold their caste or kindred into foreign slavery, unless
their crime deserved a penalty severer than death. I reflected
a while on the message, because I did not wish to complicate
my relations with the leading chiefs of the interior; but, in a
few moments, natural sensibility mastered every selfish impulse,
and I told the envoy to hasten back on the path of the suffering
brother, and assure him I would shield his sister, even at
the risk of his kindred&rsquo;s wrath.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
About a week afterwards I was aroused one morning by a
runner from a neighboring village over the hill, who stated that
a courier reached his town the night before from Sulimani-Ali,&mdash;a
prince of Timbo,&mdash;conducting a Fullah girl, who was to be
sold by me <i>immediately</i> to a Spanish slaver. The girl, he said,
resisted with all her energy. She refused to walk. For the last
four days she had been borne along in a litter. She swore never
to &ldquo;see the ocean;&rdquo; and threatened to dash her skull against
the first rock in her path, if they attempted to carry her further.
The stanch refusal embarrassed her Mahometan conductor, inasmuch
as his country&rsquo;s law forbade him to use extraordinary compulsion,
or degrade the maiden with a whip.</p>

<p>I saw at once that this delay and hesitation afforded an opportunity
to interfere judiciously in behalf of the spirited girl,
whose sins or faults were still unknown to me. Accordingly, I
imparted the tale to Ali-Ninpha; and, with his consent, despatched
a shrewd dame from the Mandingo&rsquo;s <i>harem</i>, with directions
for her conduct to the village. Woman&rsquo;s tact and woman&rsquo;s
sympathy are the same throughout the world, and the proud ambassadress
undertook her task with pleased alacrity. I warned
her to be extremely cautious before the myrmidons of Sulimani,
but to seize a secret moment when she might win the maiden&rsquo;s
confidence, to inform her that I was the sworn friend of Ahmah-de-Bellah,
and would save her <i>if she followed my commands
implicitly</i>. She must cease resistance at once. She must come
to the river, which was fresh water, and not salt; and she must
allow her jailers to fulfil all the orders they received from her
tyrannical kinsmen. Muffled in the messenger&rsquo;s garments, I sent
the manuscript Koran of Ahmah-de-Bellah as a token of my
truth, and bade the dame assure Beeljie that her brother was
already far on his journey to redeem her in Kambia.</p>

<p>The mission was successful, and, early next day, the girl was
brought to my factory, <i>with a rope round her neck</i>.</p>

<p>The preliminaries for her purchase were tedious and formal.
As her sale was compulsory, there was not much question as to
quality or price. Still, I was obliged to promise a multitude of
things I did not intend to perform. In order to disgrace the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
poor creature as much as possible, her sentence declared she
should be &ldquo;sold for salt,&rdquo;&mdash;the most contemptuous of all African
exchanges, and used in the interior for the purchase of <i>cattle</i>
alone.</p>

<p>Poor Beeljie stood naked and trembling before us while these
ceremonies were performing. A scowl of indignation flitted like
a shadow over her face, as she heard the disgusting commands.
Tenderly brought up among the princely brood of Timbo, she was
a bright and delicate type of the classes I described at the brook-side.
Her limbs and features were stained by the dust of travel,
and her expression was clouded with the grief of sensible degradation:
still I would have risked more than I did, when I beheld
the mute appeal of her face and form, to save her from the doom
of Cuban exile.</p>

<p>When the last tub of salt was measured, I cut the rope from
Beeljie&rsquo;s neck, and, throwing over her shoulders a shawl,&mdash;in
which she instantly shrank with a look of gratitude,&mdash;called the
female who had borne my cheering message, to take the girl to
her house and treat her as the sister of my Fullah brother.</p>

<p>As I expected, this humane command brought the emissary
of Sulimani to his feet with a bound. He insisted on the restitution
of the woman! He swore I had deceived him; and, in
fact, went through a variety of African antics which are not unusual,
even among the most civilized of the tribes, when excited
to extraordinary passion.</p>

<p>It was my habit, during these outbursts of native ire, to
remain perfectly quiet, not only until the explosion was over,
but while the smoke was disappearing from the scene. I fastened
my eye, therefore, silently, but intensely, on the tiger, following
him in all his movements about the apartment, till he
sank subdued and panting, on the mat. I then softly told him
that this excitement was not only unbecoming a Mahometan gentleman,
and fit for a savage alone, but that it was altogether
wasted on the present occasion, <i>inasmuch as the girl should be
put on board a slaver in his presence</i>. Nevertheless, I continued
while the sister of Ahmah was under my roof, her blood
must be respected, and she should be treated in every respect
as a royal person.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
I was quite as curious as the reader may be to know the
crime of Beeljie, for, up to that moment, I had not been informed
of it. Dismissing the Fullah as speedily as possible, I
hastened to Ali-Ninpha&rsquo;s dwelling and heard the sufferer&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>The Mahometan princess, whose age surely did not exceed
eighteen, had been promised by the king and her half-brother,
Sulimani, to an old relative, who was not only accused of cruelty
to his harem&rsquo;s inmates, but was charged by Mussulmen with the
heinous crime of eating &ldquo;unclean flesh.&rdquo; The girl, who seemed
to be a person of masculine courage and determination, resisted
this disposal of her person; but, while her brother Ahmah was
away, she was forced from her mother&rsquo;s arms and given to the
filthy dotard.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed that women are doomed to the
basest obedience in oriental lands; yet, it seems there is a Mahometan
law,&mdash;or, at least, a Fullah custom,&mdash;which saves the
purity of an unwilling bride. The delivery of Beeljie to her
brutal lord kindled the fire of an ardent temper. She furnished
the old gentleman with specimens of violence to which his harem
had been a stranger, save when the master himself chose to indulge
in wrath. In fact, the Fullah damsel&mdash;half acting, half
in reality&mdash;played the virago so finely, that her husband, after
exhausting arguments, promises and supplications, sent her back
to her kindred <i>with an insulting message</i>.</p>

<p>It was a sad day when she returned to the paternal roof in
Timbo. Her resistance was regarded by the dropsical despot as
rebellious disobedience to father and brother; and, as neither
authority nor love would induce the outlaw to repent, her barbarous
parent condemned her to be &ldquo;<i>a slave to Christians</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her story ended, I consoled the poor maiden with every
assurance of protection and comfort; for, now that the excitement
of sale and journey was over, her nerves gave way, and she
sank on her mat, completely exhausted. I commended her to
the safeguard of my landlord and the especial kindness of his
women. Esther, too, stole up at night to comfort the sufferer
with her fondling tenderness, for she could not speak the Fullah
language;&mdash;and in a week, I had the damsel in capital condition
ready for a daring enterprise that was to seal her fate.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
When the Spanish slaver, whose cargo I had just completed,
was ready for sea, I begged her captain to aid me in the shipment
of &ldquo;<i>a princess</i>&rdquo; who had been consigned to my wardship
by her royal relations in the interior, but whom I dared not put
on board his vessel <i>until she was beyond the Rio Pongo&rsquo;s bar</i>.
The officer assented; and when the last boat-load of slaves was
despatched from my <i>barracoon</i>, he lifted his anchor and floated
down the stream till he got beyond the furthest breakers. Here,
with sails loosely furled, and every thing ready for instant departure,
he again laid to, awaiting the royal <i>bonne-bouche</i>.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I hurried Beeljie with her friends and
Fullah jailer to the beach, so that when the slaver threw his sails
aback and brought his vessel to the wind, I lost not a moment in
putting the girl in a canoe, with five Kroomen to carry her
through the boiling surf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allah be praised!&rdquo; sighed the Fullah, as the boat shot
ahead into the sea; while the girls of the harem fell on the sand
with wails of sorrow. The Kroomen, with their usual skill,
drove the buoyant skiff swiftly towards the slaver; but, as they
approached the breakers south of the bar, a heavy roller struck
it on the side, and instantly, its freight was struggling in the
surge.</p>

<p>In a twinkling, the Fullah was on the earth, his face buried
in the sand; the girls screamed and tore their garments; Ali-Ninpha&rsquo;s
wife clung to me with the grasp of despair; while I,
stamping with rage, cursed the barbarity of the maiden&rsquo;s parent,
whose sentence had brought her to this wretched fate.</p>

<p>I kicked the howling hypocrite beneath me, and bade him
hasten with the news to Timbo, and tell the wicked patriarch
that the Prophet himself had destroyed the life of his wretched
child, sooner than suffer her to become a Christian&rsquo;s slave.</p>

<p>The Spanish vessel was under full sail, sweeping rapidly out
to sea, and the Kroomen swam ashore without their boat, as the
grieving group slowly and sadly retraced their way along the
river&rsquo;s bank to Kambia.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">
<img src="images/canot04.png" width="700" height="521" alt="" />
<span class="caption">THE SHIPPING OF BEELJIE.</span>
</div>

<p>There was wailing that night in the village, and there was
wailing in Timbo when the Fullah returned with the tragic story.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
In fact, such was the distracted excitement both on the sea-shore
and in the settlement, that none of my companions had eyes to
observe an episode of the drama which had been played that
evening without rehearsal.</p>

<p>Every body who has been on the coast of Africa, or read of
its people, knows that Kroomen are altogether unaware of any
difference between a smooth river and the angriest wave.
They would as willingly be upset in the surf as stumble against
a rock. I took advantage of this amphibious nature, to station
a light canoe immediately on the edge of the breakers, and to
order the daring swimmers it contained to grasp the girl the
moment her canoe was <i>purposely upset</i>! I promised the divers
a liberal reward if they lodged her in their boat, or swam with
her to the nearest point of the opposite beach; and so well did
they perform their secret task, that when they drew ashore her
fainting body, it was promptly received by a trusty Bager, who
was in waiting on the beach. Before the girl recovered her
senses she was safely afloat in the fisherman&rsquo;s canoe. His home
was in a village on the coast below; and, perhaps, it still remains
a secret to this day, how it was that, <i>for years after, a girl, the
image of the lost Beeljie, followed the footsteps of Ahmah, the
Fullah of Timbo</i>!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>


<p>After my toilsome journey to the interior, my despatch of a
slaver, and my adventurous enterprise in behalf of a Fullah princess,
I thought myself entitled to a long <i>siesta</i>; but my comfortable
desires and anticipations were doomed to disappointment.
I was suddenly stirred from this willing lethargy by a salute of
twenty-one guns in the offing. Our wonder was almost insupportable
as to the character of the ceremonious stranger who
wasted powder so profusely, while a boy was despatched to the
top of the look-out tree to ascertain his character. He reported
a schooner anchored opposite Bangalang, sporting a long pendant
at the main, and a white ensign at her peak. I took it for granted
that no man-of-war would <i>salute</i> a native chief, and so concluded
that it was some pretentious Frenchman, unacquainted with the
prudent customs of our demure coast.</p>

<p>The conjecture was right. At nightfall Mr. Ormond&mdash;whose
humor had somewhat improved since my return&mdash;apprised me
that a Gallic slaver had arrived to his consignment with a rich
cargo, and hoped I would join him at breakfast on board, by invitation
of the commander.</p>

<p>Next morning, at sunrise, the Mongo and myself met for the
first time after our rupture with apparent cordiality on the deck
of &ldquo;La Perouse,&rdquo; where we were welcomed with all that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
cordiality of grimace for which a half-bred Frenchman is so justly
celebrated. Captain Brul&ocirc;t could not speak English, nor could
Mr. Ormond express himself in French; so we wasted the time
till breakfast was served in discussing his cargo and prospects,
through my interpretation. Fine samples of gaudy calicoes,
French guns, and superior brandy, were exhibited and dwelt on
with characteristic eloquence; but the Gaul closed his bewitching
catalogue with a shout of joy that made the cabin ring, as
he announced the complement of his cargo to be <i>five hundred
doubloons</i>. The scent of gold has a peculiar charm to African
slavers, and it will readily be supposed that our appetite for the
promised <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> was not a little stimulated by the Spanish
coin. As rapidly as we could, we summed up the doubloons
and his merchandise; and, estimating the entire cargo at about
$17,000, offered him three hundred and fifty negroes for the lot.
The bid was no sooner made than accepted. Our private boats
were sent ashore in search of canoes to discharge the goods, and,
with a relish and spirit I never saw surpassed, we sat down to a
piquant breakfast, spread on deck beneath the awning.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to remember the dishes which provoked
our appetites and teased our thirst. We were happy already on
the delightful claret that washed down the viands; but, after
the substantials were gone, coffee was served, and succeeded by
half a dozen various cordials, the whole being appropriately
capped by the foam of champagne.</p>

<p>When the last bumper was quaffed in honor of &ldquo;La Perouse&rdquo;
and &ldquo;belle France,&rdquo; Captain Brul&ocirc;t called for his writing-desk;
when, at the instant, four men sprung up as if by enchantment
behind the Mongo and myself, and grasping our arms with the
gripe of a vice, held us in their clutches till the carpenter riveted
a shackle on our feet.</p>

<p>The scene passed so rapidly,&mdash;the transition from gayety to
outrage was so sharp and violent, that my bewildered mind cannot
now declare with certainty, whether mirth or anger prevailed
at the clap-trap trick of this dramatic <i>denouement</i>. I am quite
sure, however, that if I laughed at first, I very soon swore; for
I have a distinct recollection of dashing my fist in the poltroon&rsquo;s
face before he could extemporize an explanation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
When our limbs were perfectly secure, the French scoundrel
recommenced his shrugs, bows, grins and cong&eacute;es; and approaching
Mr. Ormond with a sarcastic simper, apprised him that the
<i>petite comedie</i> in which he took part, had been enacted for the
collection of a trifling debt which his excellency the Mongo
owed a beloved brother, who, alas! was no longer on earth to
collect it for himself!</p>

<p><i>Monsieur le Mongo</i>, he said, would have the kindness to
remember that, several years ago, his brother had left some
<i>two hundred slaves</i> in his hands until called for; and he would
also please to take the trouble to recollect, that the said slaves
had been twice sent for, and twice refused. <i>Monsieur le Mongo</i>
must know, he continued, that there was not much law on the
coast of Africa; and that, as he had Monsieur le Mongo&rsquo;s promissory
note, or due-bill, for the negroes, he thought this charming
little <i>ruse</i> would be the most amiable and practical mode of
enforcing it! Did his friend, <i>le Mongo</i>, intend to honor this
draft? It was properly endorsed, he would see, in favor of the
bearer; and if the <i>esclaves</i> were quickly forthcoming, the whole
affair would pass off as agreeably and quickly as the bubbles from
a champagne glass.</p>

<p>By this time Ormond was so perfectly stupefied by drink, as
well as the atrocity, that he simply burst into a maudlin laugh,
when I looked at him for an explanation of the charge. <i>I</i>,
surely, was not implicated in it; yet, when I demanded the
cause of the assault upon <i>my</i> person, in connection with the
affair, Brul&ocirc;t replied, with a shrug, that as I was Ormond&rsquo;s clerk
when the note was signed, I <i>must</i> have had a finger in the pie;
and, inasmuch as I now possessed a factory of my own, it would
doubtless be delightful to aid my ancient patron in the liquidation
of a debt that I knew to be lawful.</p>

<p>It was altogether useless to deny my presence in the factory,
or knowledge of the transaction, which, in truth, had occurred
long before my arrival on the Rio Pongo, during the clerkship
of my predecessor. Still, I insisted on immediate release. An
hour flew by in useless parley. But the Frenchman was firm,
and swore that nothing would induce him to liberate either of us
without payment of the bill. While we were talking, a crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
of canoes was seen shoving off from Bangalang, filled with armed
men; whereupon the excited Gaul ordered his men to quarters,
and double-shotted his guns.</p>

<p>As the first boat came within striking distance, a ball was
fired across her bows, which not only sent back the advance, but
made the entire fleet tack ship and steer homeward in dismay.
Soon after, however, I heard the war-drum beating in Bangalang,
and could see the natives mustering in great numbers along the
river banks; yet, what could undisciplined savages effect against
the skinned teeth of our six-pounders? At sunset, however, my
clerk came off, with a white flag, and the captain allowed him to
row alongside to receive our orders in his presence. Ormond
was not yet in a state to consult as to our appropriate means of
rescue from the trickster&rsquo;s clutches; so I directed the young
man to return in the morning with changes of raiment; but, in
the mean while, to desire the villagers of both settlements to
refrain from interference in our behalf. An excellent meal, with
abundance of claret, was served for our entertainment, and, on a
capital mattress, we passed a night of patient endurance in our
iron stockings.</p>

<p>At daylight, water and towels were served for our refreshment.
After coffee and cigars were placed on the board, Brul&ocirc;t
put by his sarcasm, and, in an off-hand fashion, demanded whether
we had come to our senses and intended to pay the debt?
My Italian blood was in a fever, and I said nothing. Ormond,
however,&mdash;now entirely sober, and who was enjoying a cigar
with the habitual <i>insouciance</i> of a mulatto,&mdash;replied quietly that
he could make no promises or arrangements whilst confined on
board, but if allowed to go ashore, he would fulfil his obligation
in two or three days. An hour was spent by the Frenchman in
pondering on the proposal; when it was finally agreed that the
Mongo should be set at liberty, provided he left, as hostages,
four of his children and two of the black chiefs who visited him
in my boat. The compact was sealed by the hoisting of a flag
under the discharge of a blank cartridge; and, in an hour, the
pledges were in the cabin, under the eye of a sentry, while the
Mongo was once more in Bangalang.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
These negotiations, it will be perceived, did not touch <i>my</i>
case, though I was in no manner guilty; yet I assented to the
proposal because I thought that Ormond would be better able
than myself to find the requisite number of slaves at that moment.
I ordered my clerk, however, to press all the indifferent
and useless servants in my factory, and to aid the Mongo with
every slave at present in my <i>barracoon</i>.</p>

<p>Before sunset of that day, this young man came aboard with
fifty negroes from my establishment, and demanded my release.
It was refused. Next day forty more were despatched by the
Mongo; but still my liberty was denied. I upbraided the
scoundrel with his meanness, and bade him look out for the day
of retribution. But he snapped his fingers at my threat as he
exclaimed: &ldquo;<i>Cher ami, ce n&rsquo;est que la fortune de guerre!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a task of difficulty to collect the remaining one hundred
and ten slaves among factories which had been recently
drained by Cuban vessels. Many domestic menials escaped to
the forest when the story became known, as they did not wish to
take the place of their betters in the &ldquo;French service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thrice had the sun risen and set since I was a prisoner.
During all the time, my blood tingled for revenge. I was
tricked, humbled and disgraced. Never did I cease to pray for
the arrival of some well-armed <i>Spanish slaver</i>; and, towards
evening of the fourth day, lo! the boon was granted! That
afternoon, a boat manned by negroes, passed with the Spanish
flag; but, as there was no white man aboard, Brul&ocirc;t took it
for a <i>ruse</i> of the Mongo, designed to alarm him into an unconditional
release of his captives.</p>

<p>I must do the Gaul the justice to declare, that during my
confinement, he behaved like a gentleman, in supplies from the
pantry and spirit-room. Neither was he uncivil or unkind in his
general demeanor. Indeed, he several times regretted that this
was the only means in his power &ldquo;to collect a promissory note
on the coast of Africa;&rdquo; yet, I was not Christian enough to
sympathize with the sheriff, or to return his compliments with
any thing but a curse. But, now that a Spaniard was within
hail, I felt a sudden lifting of the weight that was on my heart.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
I shouted for champagne! The steward brought it with alacrity,
and poured with trembling hand the bumpers I drained to
Saint Jago and old Spain. The infection soon spread. They
began to believe that a rescue was at hand. The news was
heard with dismay in the forecastle. Brul&ocirc;t alone stood obstinate,
but indecisive.</p>

<p>Presently, I called him to join me in a glass, and, as we
drank the foaming liquid, I pledged him to another &ldquo;within
twenty-four hours beneath the Spanish flag.&rdquo; The Gaul feigned
a sort of hectic hilarity as he swallowed the wine and the toast,
but he could not stand the flash of revenge in my eye and burning
cheek, and retired to consult with his officers.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>


<p>I slept soundly that night; but the sun was not clear of the
forest when I hobbled on deck in my shackles, and was searching
the seaward horizon for my beloved Castilian. Presently the
breeze began to freshen, and the tall, raking masts of a schooner
were seen gliding above the tops of the mangroves that masked
the Rio Pongo&rsquo;s mouth. Very soon the light wind and tide
drifted her clear of the bends, and an anchor was let go within
musket shot of my prison, while springs were run out to the
bushes to give range to her broadside. I saw at once, from her
man&oelig;uvres, that Ormond had communicated with the craft during
the night.</p>

<p>Brul&ocirc;t felt that his day was over. The Spaniard&rsquo;s decks
were crowded with an alert, armed crew; four charming little
bull-dogs showed their muzzles from port holes; while a large
brass swivel, amidships, gave token of its readiness to fight or
salute. For a minute or two the foiled Frenchman surveyed the
scene through his glass; then, throwing it over his shoulder,
ordered the mate to strike off my &ldquo;darbies.&rdquo; As the officer
obeyed, a voice was heard from the Spaniard, commanding a
boat to be sent aboard, under penalty of a shot if not instantly
obeyed. The boat was lowered; but who would man her? The
chief officer refused; the second declined; the French sailors
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
objected; the Creoles and mulattoes from St. Thomas went
below; so that no one was left to fulfil the slaver&rsquo;s order but
Brul&ocirc;t or myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien!</i>&rdquo; said my crest-fallen cock, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your turn to crow,
Don T&eacute;odore. Fortune seems on your side, and you are again
free. Go to the devil, if you please, <i>mon camarade</i>, and send
your imps for the slaves as soon as you want them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the Spaniard had lighted his matches, levelled
his guns, and, under the aim of his musketry, repeated the order
for a boat. Seeing the danger of our party, I leaped to the bulwarks,
and hailing my deliverer in Spanish, bade him desist.
The request was obeyed as I threw myself into the yawl, cut the
rope, and, alone, sculled the skiff to the slaver.</p>

<p>A shout went up from the deck of my deliverer as I jumped
aboard and received the cordial grasp of her commander. Ali-Ninpha,
too, was there to greet and defend me with a chosen
band of his people. While I was absorbed in the joy of welcome
and liberation, the African stole with his band to the
Frenchman&rsquo;s boat, and was rapidly filling it to board the foe,
when my clerk apprised me of the impending danger. I was
fortunate enough to control the enraged savage, else I know not
what might have been the fate of Brul&ocirc;t and the officers during
the desertion of his mongrel and cowardly crew.</p>

<p>The captain desired his mates to keep an eye on the Gaul
while we retired to the cabin for consultation; and here I
learned that I was on board the &ldquo;Esperanza,&rdquo; consigned to me
from Matanzas. In turn, I confirmed the account they had
already heard of my mishap from the Mongo&rsquo;s messengers; but
hoped the Cuban captain would permit me to take pacific revenge
after my own fashion, inasmuch as my captor&mdash;barring the irons&mdash;had
behaved with uncommon civility. I had no trouble, of
course, in obtaining the commander&rsquo;s assent to this request,
though he yielded it under the evident displeasure of his crew,
whose Spanish blood was up against the Frenchman, and would
willingly have inflicted a signal punishment on this neutral
ground.</p>

<p>After these preliminaries, Captain Escudero and myself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
returned to the &ldquo;La Perouse&rdquo; with two boat-loads of armed followers,
while our approach was covered by the cannons and small
arms of the &ldquo;Esperanza.&rdquo; Brul&ocirc;t received us in moody silence
on the quarter-deck. His officers sat sulkily on a gun to leeward,
while two or three French seamen walked to and fro on
the forecastle.</p>

<p>My first command was to spike the vessel&rsquo;s guns. Next, I
decreed and superintended the disembarkation of the stolen
slaves; and, lastly, I concluded the morning call with a request
that Brul&ocirc;t would <i>produce the five hundred doubloons and his
&ldquo;promissory note&rdquo; for two hundred slaves</i>!</p>

<p>The fatal document, duly indorsed, was quickly delivered,
but no persuasion or threat induced the angry Gaul to show
his gold, or a manifest of the cargo.</p>

<p>After ample indulgence, I despatched a man to seek his
writing-desk, and discovered that six hundred doubloons had
in reality been shipped in St. Thomas. Of course, their production
was imperiously demanded; but Brul&ocirc;t swore they had
been landed, with his supercargo, in the neighboring Rio Nunez.
I was near crediting the story, when a slight sneer I perceived
flickering over the steward&rsquo;s face, put me on the <i>qui vive</i> to request
an inspection of the log-book, which, unfortunately for my captor,
did not record the disembarkation of the cash. This demonstrated
Brul&ocirc;t&rsquo;s falsehood, and authorized a demand for his trunk.
The knave winced as the steward descended to bring it; and he
leaped with rage as I split it with a hatchet, and counted two
hundred and fifty Mexican doubloons on the deck. <i>His cargo,
however, proved to be a sham of samples.</i></p>

<p>Turning innocently to Escudero, I remarked that he must
have been put to considerable trouble in rescuing me from this
outlaw, and hoped he would suffer his men to be recompensed
for their extra toil under the rays of an African sun. I would
not venture to judge the value of such devoted services; but
requested him to fix his own price and receive payment on the
spot.</p>

<p>Escudero very naturally supposed that <i>about</i> two hundred
and fifty Mexican ounces would compensate him to a fraction,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
and, accordingly, the two hundred and fifty shiners, glistening on
the deck, forthwith returned to their bag and went overboard into
his boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Adieu! mon cher</i>,&rdquo; said I, as I followed the gold; &ldquo;<i>la
fortune de guerre</i> has many phases, you see; how do you like
this one? The next game you play on the coast of Africa, my
chicken, recollect that though a <i>knave</i> can take a trick, yet the
<i>knave may be trumped before the hand is played out</i>!&rdquo;</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>


<p>La Esperanza discharged her cargo rapidly, but, before I was
ready to send back a living freight, poor Escudero fell a victim
to African fever.</p>

<p>I had seen much of the country; I had made some money;
my clerk was a reliable fellow; I was growing somewhat anxious
for a change of scene; and, in fact, I only wanted a decent excuse
to find myself once more aboard a &ldquo;skimmer of the seas,&rdquo;
for a little relaxation after the oppressive monotony of a slaver&rsquo;s
life. Escudero&rsquo;s death seemed to offer the desired opportunity.
His mate was an inexperienced seaman; his officers were unacquainted
with the management of a slave cargo; and, upon a
view of the whole field of interests, I thought it best to take
charge of the schooner and pay a visit to my friends in Cuba.
In the mean time, however, a Danish brig arrived for negroes,
so that it became necessary for me, with my multiplied duties,
to bestir myself in the collection of slaves.</p>

<p>Whilst I was dining one afternoon at Ormond&rsquo;s factory with
the Danish captain of the trader, the boom of a gun, followed
rapidly by two or three more, announced the arrival of another
craft. We drank a toast to his advent, and were beginning to
condole a little over our difficulty in procuring blacks, when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
look-out ran into our room with the report that my Spaniard
was firing into the Dane. We rushed to the piazza whence the
scene of action might be beheld, and another shot from my vessel
seemed to indicate that she was the aggressor. The Dane
and myself hurried aboard our respective schooners, but when I
reached the Esperanza, my crew were weighing anchor, while the
quarter-deck was strewn with fire-arms. The mate stood on the
heel of the bowsprit, urging his men to alacrity; the sailors hove
at the windlass with mingled shouts of passion and oaths of
revenge; on a mattress lay the bleeding form of my second officer,
while a seaman groaned beside him with a musket ball in
his shoulder.</p>

<p>My arrival was the signal for a pause. As quickly as possible,
I inquired into the affray, which had originated like many a
sailor&rsquo;s dispute, on a question of precedence at the watering
place in a neighboring brook. The Danes were seven, and we
but three. Our Spaniards had been driven off, and my second
mate, in charge of the yawl, received a <i>trenchant</i> blow from an
oar-blade, which cut his skull and felled him senseless on the
sand.</p>

<p>Of course, &ldquo;the watering&rdquo; was over for the day, and both
boats returned to their vessels to tell their stories. The moment
the Danes got on board, they imprudently ran up their
ensign; and, as this act of apparent defiance occurred just as the
Esperanza was receiving the lifeless form of her officer, my excited
crew discharged a broadside in reply to the warlike token.
Gun followed gun, and musketry rattled against musketry. The
Dane miscalculated the range of the guns, and his grape fell
short of my schooner, while our snarling sixes made sad havoc
with his bulwarks and rigging.</p>

<p>I had hardly learned the facts of the case and thought of a
truce, when the passionate Northman sent a round-shot whistling
over my head. Another and another followed in its wake, but
they aimed too high for damage. At twenty-four our blood is
not so diplomatically pacific as in later years, and this second
aggression rekindled the lava in my Italian veins. There was
no longer question of a white flag or a parley. In a twinkling,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
I slipped my cable and ran up the jib and mainsail, so as to
swing the schooner into a raking position at short quarters; and
before the Dane could counteract my man&oelig;uvre, I gave him a
dose of grape and cannister which tore his ensign to ribbons and
spoiled the looks of his hull materially. My second shot splintered
the edge of his mast; but while I was making ready for a
third, to tickle him betwixt wind and water, down tumbled his
impertinent pendant and the day was won.</p>

<p>For a while there was a dead silence between the warriors.
Neither hailed nor sent a boat on board of the other. Ormond
perceived this cessation of hostilities from his piazza at Bangalang,
and coming out in a canoe, rowed to the Dane after hearing
my version of the battle.</p>

<p>I waited anxiously either for his return or a message, but as
I was unadvised of the Mongo&rsquo;s views and temper in regard to
the affray, I thought it well, before dark, to avoid treachery by
quitting the river and placing my schooner in a creek with her
broadside to the shore. Special charge was then given to the
mate and men to be alert all night long; after which, I went
on shore to protect the rear by placing my factory in a state
of defence.</p>

<p>But my precautions were needless. At daylight the guard
brought us news of the Dane&rsquo;s departure, and when I descended
the river to Bangalang, Ormond alleged that the slaver had
sailed for Sierra Leone to seek succor either from a man-of-war
or the British government.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that I was not so &ldquo;green&rdquo; in Africa as
to believe this story. No vessel, equipped for a slave cargo,
would dare to enter the imperial colony. Yet the Northman
had bitter cause for grief and anger. His vessel was seriously
harmed by my grape-shot; his carpenter was slain during the
action; and three of his seaman were lingering with desperate
wounds. In a few days, however, he returned to the Rio Pongo
from his airing on the Atlantic, where his wrath had probably
been somewhat cooled by the sea-breeze. His craft was anchored
higher up the river than my Spaniard, and thus our crews avoided
intercourse for the future.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
But this was not the case with the captains. The Mongo&rsquo;s
table was a sort of neutral ground, at which we met with cold
salutations but without conversation. Ormond and the Dane,
however, became exceedingly intimate. Indeed, the mulatto
appeared to exhibit a degree of friendship for the Margaritan
I had never seen him bestow on any one else. This singularity,
together with his well-known insincerity, put me on my guard to
watch his proceedings with increased caution.</p>

<p>Personal observation is always a safe means of self-assurance;
yet I have sometimes found it to be &ldquo;a way of the world,&rdquo;&mdash;not
to be altogether scorned or disregarded,&mdash;to <i>purchase</i> the
good will of &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; persons. Accordingly, I made it
&ldquo;worth the while&rdquo; of Ormond&rsquo;s body-servant to sift the secret
of this sudden devotion; and in a few days the faithless slave,
who spoke English remarkably well, told me that the Dane, by
dint of extra pay and the secret delivery of all his spare provisions
and the balance of his cargo, had induced the Mongo
to promise the delivery of his slaves before mine.</p>

<p>Now, Ormond, by a specific contract,&mdash;made and paid for
before the Dane&rsquo;s arrival,&mdash;owed me two hundred negroes on
account of the Esperanza&rsquo;s cargo. The Dane knew this perfectly,
but my severe chastisement rankled in his heart, and made
him seek revenge in the most effectual way on the coast of Africa.
He was bent upon depriving me of one hundred negroes, in the
hands of Mr. Ormond.</p>

<p>I said nothing of my discovery, nor did I make any remarks
on the astonishing love that existed between these Siamese twins;
still, I kept my eye on Ormond&rsquo;s <i>barracoon</i> until I found his
stock had gradually augmented to three hundred. Thereupon,
I dropped in one morning unceremoniously, and, in a gentle
voice, told him of his treacherous design. My ancient patron
was so degraded by debauchery, that he not only avoided a passionate
outburst when I made the charge, but actually seemed
to regard it as a sort of capital joke, or recompense for the damage
I had inflicted on the Dane! We did not dream of arguing
the propriety or impropriety of his conduct; nor did I think of
upbraiding him with baseness, as I would have done any one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
who had dipped only his finger-tips in fraud. Still, ever and
anon, I saw a glimmer of former spirit in the wretch, and thought
I would attempt a counter-mine of interest, which Ormond might
probably understand and grasp. I resolved, in fact, to <i>outbid</i>
the Dane, for I thought I possessed a card that could take him.
Accordingly, I offered to surrender a bond for one hundred slaves
he owed me on account of the Esperanza; I promised, moreover,
one hundred and fifty negroes, to be delivered that evening,&mdash;and
I tendered <i>Brul&ocirc;t&rsquo;s promissory note for the missing two hundred
darkies</i>,&mdash;if he would pledge himself <i>to load the Dane
during the succeeding night</i>!</p>

<p>Ormond took the hint like tinder, and grasped my hand on the
bargain. The Dane was ordered to prepare his vessel to receive
cargo without delay, and was specially desired <i>to drop down
about fifteen miles towards the bar, so as to be off the moment his
slaves were under hatches</i>!</p>

<p>For the next six hours there was not a busier bee on the Rio
Pongo than Don T&eacute;odore. My schooner was put in ship-shape
for cargo. The mate was ordered to have his small arms and
cutlasses in perfect condition. Our pivot gun was double-loaded
with chain-shot. My factory was set in order, and written directions
given the clerk in anticipation of a four months&rsquo; absence.
Ali-Ninpha was put in charge of the territorial domain, while
my Spaniard was intrusted with the merchandise.</p>

<p>It was encouraging to see, in the course of the afternoon, that
my northern rival had swallowed the bait, for he borrowed a
kedge to aid him, as he said, in descending the river against the
tide, in order to &ldquo;<i>get a better berth</i>.&rdquo; He found the trees and
air uncomfortable sixteen miles from the bar, and wanted to
approach it to be &ldquo;nearer the sea-breeze!&rdquo; The adroitness of
his excuse made me laugh in my sleeve, as the clumsy trickster
shot past me with his sails unbent.</p>

<p>Well,&mdash;night came on, with as much darkness as ever robes
the star-lit skies of Africa when the moon is obscured. My long
boat was quickly filled with ten men, armed with pistol and cutlass;
and in a short time, the canoes from Bangalang hove in sight
with their sable burden. I boarded the first one myself,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
commanding the rowers to pull for my Spaniard. The second was
seized by the mate, who followed in my wake. The third, fourth,
fifth and sixth, shared the same fate in rapid succession; so
that, in an hour, three hundred and seventy-five negroes were,
safe beneath the Esperanza&rsquo;s deck. Thereupon, I presented the
head-man of each canoe a document acknowledging the receipt of
his slaves, <i>and wrote an order on the Mongo in favor of the
Dane, for the full amount of the darkies I had borrowed</i>!</p>

<p>The land wind sprang up and the tide turned when daylight
warned me it was time to be off; and, as I passed the Dane
snugly at anchor just inside the bar, I called all hands to give
three cheers, and to wish him happiness in the &ldquo;enjoyment of
his sea-breeze.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>


<p>When the land-breeze died away, it fell entirely calm, and the
sea continued an unruffled mirror for three days, during which
the highlands remained in sight, like a faint cloud in the east.
The glaring sky and the reflecting ocean acted and reacted on
each other until the air glowed like a furnace. During night a
dense fog enveloped the vessel with its clammy folds. When
the vapor lifted on the fourth morning, our look-out announced
a sail from the mast-head, and every eye was quickly sweeping
the landward horizon in search of the stranger. Our spies along
the beach had reported the coast clear of cruisers when I sailed,
so that I hardly anticipated danger from men-of-war; nevertheless,
we held it discreet to avoid intercourse, and accordingly,
our double-manned sweeps were rigged out to impel us slowly
towards the open ocean. Presently, the mate went aloft with
his glass, and, after a deliberate gaze, exclaimed: &ldquo;It is only
the Dane,&mdash;I see his flag.&rdquo; At this my crew swore they would
sooner fight than sweep in such a latitude; and, with three
cheers, came aft to request that I would remain quietly where I
was until the Northman overhauled us.</p>

<p>We made so little headway with oars that I thought the difference
trifling, whether we pulled or were becalmed. Perhaps,
it might be better to keep the hands fresh, if a conflict proved
inevitable. I passed quickly among the men, with separate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
inquiries as to their readiness for battle, and found all&mdash;from the
boy to the mate&mdash;anxious, at every hazard, to do their duty.
Our breakfast was as cold as could be served in such a climate,
but I made it palatable with a case of claret.</p>

<p>When a sail on the coast of Africa heaves in sight of <i>a slaver</i>,
it is always best for the imperilled craft, especially if gifted with
swift hull and spreading wings, to take flight without the courtesies
that are usual in mercantile sea-life. At the present day,
fighting is, of course, out of the question, and the valuable prize
is abandoned by its valueless owners. At all times, however,&mdash;and
as a guard against every risk, whether the cue be to fight or
fly,&mdash;the prudent slaver, as soon as he finds himself in the neighborhood
of unwholesome canvas, puts out his fire, nails his forecastle,
sends his negroes below, and secures the gratings over his
hatches.</p>

<p>All these preparations were quietly made on board the Esperanza;
and, in addition, I ordered a supply of small arms and
ammunition on deck, where they were instantly covered with
blankets. Every man was next stationed at his post, or where
he might be most serviceable. The cannons were sponged and
loaded with care; and, as I desired to deceive our new acquaintance,
I ran up the Portuguese flag. The calm still continued as
the day advanced;&mdash;indeed, I could not perceive a breath of air
by our dog-vane, which veered from side to side as the schooner
rolled slowly on the lazy swell. The stranger did not approach,
nor did we advance. There we hung&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A painted ship upon a painted ocean!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I cannot describe the fretful anxiety which vexes a mind under
such circumstances. Slaves below; a blazing sun above; the
boiling sea beneath; a withering air around; decks piled with
materials of death; escape unlikely; a phantom in chase behind;
the ocean like an unreachable eternity before; uncertainty every
where; and, within your skull, a feverish mind, harassed by
doubt and responsibility, yet almost craving for any act of desperation
that will remove the spell. It is a living nightmare,
from which the soul pants to be free.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
With torments like these, I paced the deck for half an hour
beneath the awning, when, seizing a telescope and mounting the
rigging, I took deliberate aim at the annoyer. He was full
seven or eight miles away from us, but very soon I saw, or fancied
I saw, a row of ports, which the Dane had not: then sweeping
the horizon a little astern of the craft, I distinctly made out
three boats, fully manned, making for us with ensigns flying.</p>

<p>Anxious to avoid a panic, I descended leisurely, and ordered
the sweeps to be spread once more in aid of the breeze, which,
within the last ten minutes, had freshened enough to fan us along
about a knot an hour. Next, I imparted my discovery to the
officers; and, passing once more among the men to test their
nerves, I said it was likely they would have to encounter an
angrier customer than the Dane. In fact, I frankly told them
our antagonist was unquestionably a British cruiser of ten or
twelve guns, from whose clutches there was no escape, unless we
repulsed the boats.</p>

<p>I found my crew as confident in the face of augmented risk
as they had been when we expected the less perilous Dane.
Collecting their votes for fight or surrender, I learned that all
<i>but two</i> were in favor of resistance. I had no doubt in regard
<i>to the mates</i>, in our approaching trials.</p>

<p>By this time the breeze had again died away to utter calmness,
while the air was so still and fervent that our sweltering
men almost sank at the sweeps. I ordered them in, threw overboard
several water-casks that encumbered the deck, and hoisted
our boat to the stern-davits to prevent boarding in that quarter.
Things were perfectly ship-shape all over the schooner, and I
congratulated myself that her power had been increased by two
twelve pound carronades, the ammunition, and part of the crew
of a Spanish slaver, abandoned on the bar of Rio Pongo a week
before my departure. We had in all seven guns, and abundance
of musketry, pistols and cutlasses, to be wielded and managed
by thirty-seven hands.</p>

<p>By this time the British boats, impelled by oars alone,
approached within half a mile, while the breeze sprang up in
cat&rsquo;s-paws all round the eastern horizon, but without fanning us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
with a single breath. Taking advantage of one of these slants,
the cruiser had followed her boats, but now, about five miles off,
was again as perfectly becalmed as <i>we</i> had been all day. Presently,
I observed the boats converge within the range of my
swivel, and lay on their oars as if for consultation. I seized this
opportunity, while the enemy was huddled together, to give him
the first welcome; and, slewing the schooner round with my
sweeps, I sent him a shot from my swivel. But the ball passed
over their heads, while, with three cheers, they separated,&mdash;the
largest boat making directly for our waist, while the others steered
to cross our bow and attack our stern.</p>

<p>During the chase my weapons, with the exception of the pivot
gun, were altogether useless, but I kept a couple of sweeps
ahead and a couple astern to play the schooner, and employed
that loud-tongued instrument as the foe approached. The larger
boat, bearing a small carronade, was my best target, yet we contrived
to miss each other completely until my sixth discharge,
when a double-headed shot raked the whole bank of starboard
oar-blades, and disabled the rowers by the severe concussion.
This paralyzed the launch&rsquo;s advance, and allowed me to devote
my exclusive attention to the other boats; yet, before I could
bring the schooner in a suitable position, a signal summoned the
assailants aboard the cruiser to repair damages. I did not
reflect until this moment of reprieve, that, early in the day, I
had hoisted the Portuguese ensign <i>to deceive the Dane</i>, and
imprudently left it aloft in the presence of <i>John Bull</i>! I struck
the false flag at once, unfurled the Spanish, and refreshing the
men with a double allowance of grog and grub, put them
again to the sweeps. When the cruisers reached their vessels,
the men instantly re-embarked, while the boats were allowed to
swing alongside, which convinced me that the assault would be
renewed as soon as the rum and roast-beef of Old England had
strengthened the heart of the adversary. Accordingly, noon had
not long passed when our pursuers again embarked. Once more
they approached, divided as before, and again we exchanged
ineffectual shots. I kept them at bay with grape and musketry
until I hear three o&rsquo;clock, when a second signal of retreat was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
hoisted on the cruiser, and answered by exultant <i>vivas</i> from my
crew. It grieved me, I confess, not to mingle my voice with
these shouts, for I was sure that the lion retreated to make a
better spring, nor was I less disheartened when the mate reported
that nearly all the ammunition for our cannons was exhausted.
Seven kegs of powder were still in the magazine, though not
more than a dozen rounds of grape, cannister, or balls, remained
in the locker. There was still an abundance of cartridges for
pistols and musketry, but these were poor defences against resolute
Englishmen whose blood was up and who would unquestionably
renew the charge with reinforcements of vigorous men.
Fore and aft, high and low, we searched for missiles. Musket
balls were crammed in bags; bolts and nails were packed in
cartridge paper; slave shackles were formed with rope-yarns
into chain-shot; and, in an hour, we were once more tolerably
prepared to pepper the foe.</p>

<p>When these labors terminated, I turned my attention to the
relaxed crew, portions of whom refused wine, and began to sulk
about the decks. As yet only two had been slightly scratched
by spent musket balls; but so much discontent began to appear
among the passenger-sailors of the wrecked slaver, that my own
hands could with difficulty restrain them from revolt. I felt
much difficulty in determining how to act, but I had no time for
deliberation. Violence was clearly not my <i>r&ocirc;le</i>, but persuasion
was a delicate game in such straits among men whom I did not
command with the absolute authority of a master. I cast my
eye over the taffrail, and seeing that the British boats were still
afar, I followed my first impulse, and calling the whole gang to
the quarter-deck, tried the effect of African palaver and Spanish
gold. I spoke of the perils of capture and of the folly of surrendering
<i>a slaver</i> while there was the slightest <i>hope</i> of escape.
I painted the unquestionable result of being taken after such resistance
as had already been made. I drew an accurate picture
of a tall and dangerous instrument on which piratical gentlemen
have sometimes been known to terminate their lives; and finally,
I attempted to improve the rhythm of my oratory by a couple of
golden ounces to each combatant, and the promise of a slave
apiece at the end of our <i>successful</i> voyage.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
My suspense was terrible, as there,&mdash;on the deck of a slaver,
amid calm, heat, battle, and mutiny, with a volcano of three hundred
and seventy-five imprisoned devils below me,&mdash;I awaited a
reply, which, favorable or unfavorable, I must hear without emotion.
Presently, three or four came forward and accepted my
offer. I shrugged my shoulders, and took half a dozen turns up
and down the deck. Then, turning to the crowd, I <i>doubled my
bounty</i>, and offering a boat to take the recusants on board the
enemy, swore that I would stand by the Esperanza with my unaided
crew in spite of the <i>dastards</i>!</p>

<p>The offensive word with which I closed the harangue seemed
to touch the right string of the Spanish guitar, and in an instant
I saw the dogged heads spring up with a jerk of mortified pride,
while the steward and cabin-boy poured in a fresh supply of
wine, and a shout of union went up from both divisions. I lost
no time in confirming my converts; and, ramming down my eloquence
with a wad of doubloons, ordered every man to his post,
for the enemy was again in motion.</p>

<p>But he did not come alone. New actors had appeared on the
scene during my engagement with the crew. The sound of the
cannonade had been heard, it seems, by a consort of his Britannic
Majesty&rsquo;s brig * * * *;<a name="FNanchor_E_8" id="FNanchor_E_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_8" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> and, although the battle was not
within her field of vision, she despatched another squadron of
boats under the guidance of the reports that boomed through the
silent air.</p>

<p>The first division of my old assailants was considerably in advance
of the reinforcement; and, in perfect order, approached us
in a solid body, with the apparent determination of boarding on
the same side. Accordingly, I brought all my weapons and
hands to that quarter, and told both gunners and musketeers not
to fire without orders. Waiting their discharge I allowed them
to get close; but the commander of the launch seemed to anticipate
my plan by the reservation of his fire till he could draw
mine, in order to throw his other boat-loads on board under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
smoke of his swivel and small arms. It was odd to witness our
mutual forbearance, nor could I help laughing, even in the midst
of danger, at the mutual checkmate we were trying to prepare.
However, my Britons did not avoid pulling, though they omitted
firing, so that they were already rather perilously close when
I thought it best to give them the contents of my pivot, which I
had crammed almost to the muzzle with bolts and bullets. The
discharge paralyzed the advance, while my carronades flung a
quantity of grape into the companion boats. In turn, however,
they plied us so deftly with balls from swivels and musketry,
that five of our most valuable defenders writhed in death on the
deck.</p>

<p>The rage of battle at closer quarters than heretofore, and the
screams of bleeding comrades beneath their feet, roused to its
fullest extent the ardent nature of my Spanish crew. They tore
their garments; stripped to their waists; called for rum; and
swore they would die rather than yield!</p>

<p>By this time the consort&rsquo;s reinforcement was rapidly approaching;
and, with hurrah after hurrah, the five fresh boats
came on in double column. As they drew within shot, each
cheer was followed with a fatal volley, under which several more
of our combatants were prostrated, while a glancing musket ball
lacerated my knee with a painful wound. For five minutes we
met this onset with cannon, muskets, pistols, and enthusiastic
shouts; but in the despairing confusion of the hour, the captain
of our long gun rammed home his ball before the powder, so that
when the priming burnt, the most reliable of our weapons was
silent forever! At this moment a round shot from the launch
dismounted a carronade;&mdash;our ammunition was wasted;&mdash;and in
this disabled state, the Britons prepared to board our crippled
craft. Muskets, bayonets, pistols, swords, and knives, for a
space kept them at bay, even at short quarters; but the crowded
boats tumbled their enraged fighters over our forecastle like
surges from the sea, and, cutlass in hand, the victorious furies
swept every thing before them. The cry was to &ldquo;spare no one!&rdquo;
Down went sailor after sailor, struggling with the frenzied passion
of despair. Presently an order went forth to split the gratings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
and release the slaves. I clung to my post and cheered the
battle to the last; but when I heard this fatal command, which,
if obeyed, might bury assailant and defender in common ruin, I
ordered the remnant to throw down their arms, while I struck
the flag and warned the rash and testy Englishman to beware.</p>

<p>The senior officer of the boarding party belonged to the division
from the cruiser&rsquo;s consort. As he reached the deck, his element
eye fell sadly on the scene of blood, and he commanded
&ldquo;quarter&rdquo; immediately. It was time. The excited boarders from
the repulsed boats had mounted our deck brimming with revenge.
Every one that opposed was cut down without mercy; and in another
moment, it is likely I would have joined the throng of the
departed.</p>

<p>All was over! There was a hushed and panting crowd of
victors and vanquished on the bloody deck, when the red ball of
the setting sun glared through a crimson haze and filled the motionless
sea with liquid fire. For the first time that day I became
sensible of personal sufferings. A stifling sensation made
me gasp for air as I sat down on the taffrail of my captured
schooner, and felt that I was&mdash;a prisoner!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>


<p>After a brief pause, the commanding officers of both divisions
demanded my papers, which, while I acknowledged myself <i>his</i>
prisoner, I yielded to the <i>senior</i> personage who had humanely
stopped the massacre. I saw that this annoyed the other, whom
I had so frequently repulsed; yet I thought the act fair as well as
agreeable to my feelings, for I considered my crew competent to
resist the <i>first division successfully</i>, had it not been succored by
the consort&rsquo;s boats.</p>

<p>But my decision was not submitted to by the defeated leader
without a dispute, which was conducted with infinite harshness,
until the senior ended the quarrel by ordering his junior to tow
the prize within reach of the corvette * * * *. My boat,
though somewhat riddled with balls, was lowered, and I was
commanded to go on board the captor, with my papers and servant
under the escort of a midshipman. The captain stood at
the gangway as I approached, and, seeing my bloody knee,
ordered me not to climb the ladder, but to be hoisted on deck
and sent below for the immediate care of my wound. It was
hardly more than a severe laceration of flesh, yet was quite
enough to prevent me from bending my knee, though it did not
deny locomotion with a stiff leg.</p>

<p>The dressing over,&mdash;during which I had quite a pleasant chat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
with the amiable surgeon,&mdash;I was summoned to the cabin, where
numerous questions were put, all of which I answered frankly
and <i>truly</i>. Thirteen of my crew were slain, and nearly all the
rest wounded. My papers were next inspected, and found to be
Spanish. &ldquo;How was it, then,&rdquo; exclaimed the commander, &ldquo;that
you fought under the Portuguese flag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was the question I always expected, and for which I
had in vain taxed my wit and ingenuity to supply a reasonable
excuse! I had nothing to say for the daring violation of
nationality; so I resolved to tell the truth boldly about my dispute
with the Dane, and my desire to deceive him early in the
day, but I cautiously omitted the adroitness with which I had
deprived him of his darkies. I confessed that I forgot the flag
when I found I had a different foe from the Dane to contend
with, and I flattered myself with the hope that, had I repulsed
the first unaided onset, I would have been able to escape with
the usual sea-breeze.</p>

<p>The captain looked at me in silence a while, and, in a sorrowful
voice, asked if I was aware that my defence under the Portuguese
ensign, no matter what tempted its use, could only be
construed as an act of <i>piracy</i>!</p>

<p>A change of color, an earnest gaze at the floor, compressed
lips and clenched teeth, were my only replies.</p>

<p>This painful scrutiny took place before the surgeon, whose
looks and expressions strongly denoted his cordial sympathy
with my situation. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain * * * *, &ldquo;it is a pity
for a sailor who fights as bravely as you have done, in defence
of what he considers his property, to be condemned for a combination
of mistakes and forgetfulness. However, let us not hasten
matters; you are hungry and want rest, and, though we are
navy-men, and on the coast of Africa, we are not savages.&rdquo; I
was then directed to remain where I was till further orders,
while my servant came below with an abundant supply of provisions.
The captain went on deck, but the doctor remained.
Presently, I saw the surgeon and the commander&rsquo;s steward busy
over a basket of biscuits, meat and bottles, to the handle of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
which a cord, several yards in length, was carefully knotted.
After this was arranged, the doctor called for a lamp, and unrolling
a chart, asked whether I knew the position of the vessel.
I replied affirmatively, and, at his request, measured the distance,
and noted the course to the nearest land, which was Cape Verga,
about thirty-seven miles off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Don T&eacute;odore, if I were in your place, with the prospect
of a noose and tight-rope dancing before me, I have not the
slightest hesitation in saying that I would make an attempt to
know what Cape Verga is made of before twenty-four hours
were over my head! And see, my good fellow, how Providence,
accident, or fortune favors you! First of all, your own boat
<i>happens</i> to be towing astern beneath these very cabin windows;
secondly, a basket of provisions, water and brandy, stands packed
on the transom, almost ready to slip into the boat by itself;
next, your boy is in the neighborhood to help you with the skiff;
and, finally, it is pitch dark, perfectly calm, and there isn&rsquo;t a
sentry to be seen aft the cabin door. Now, good night, my
clever fighter, and let me never have the happiness of seeing your
face again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said this, he rose, shaking my hand with the hearty
grasp of a sailor, and, as he passed my servant, slipped something
into his pocket, which proved to be a couple of sovereigns.
Meanwhile, the steward appeared with blankets, which he spread
on the locker; and, blowing out the lamp, went on deck with a
&ldquo;good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was very still, and unusually dark. There was dead
silence in the corvette. Presently, I crawled softly to the stern
window, and lying flat on my stomach over the transom, peered
out into night. There, in reality, was my boat towing astern by
a slack line! As I gazed, some one on deck above me drew in
the rope with softest motion, until the skiff lay close under the
windows. Patiently, slowly, cautiously,&mdash;fearing the sound of
his fall, and dreading almost the rush of my breath in the profound
silence,&mdash;I lowered my boy into the boat. The basket
followed. The negro fastened the boat-hook to the cabin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
window, and on this, lame as I was, I followed the basket. Fortunately,
not a plash, a crack, or a footfall disturbed the silence.
I looked aloft, and no one was visible on the quarter-deck. A
slight jerk brought the boat-rope softly into the water, and I
drifted away into the darkness.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>


<p>I drifted without a word or motion, and almost without breathing,
until the corvette was perfectly obliterated against the hazy
horizon. When every thing was dark around me, save the guiding
stars, I put out the oars and pulled quietly towards the east.
At day-dawn I was apparently alone on the ocean.</p>

<p>My appetite had improved so hugely by the night&rsquo;s exercise,
that my first devotion was to the basket, which I found crammed
with bolog&ntilde;a sausages, a piece of salt junk, part of a ham, abundance
of biscuit, four bottles of water, two of brandy, a pocket
compass, a jack-knife, and a large table-cloth or sheet, which the
generous doctor had no doubt inserted to serve as a sail.</p>

<p>The humbled <i>slaver</i> and the <i>slave</i>, for the first time in their
lives, broke bread from the same basket, and drank from the
same bottle! Misfortune had strangely and suddenly levelled us
on the basis of common humanity. The day before, he was the
most servile of menials; to-day he was my equal, and, probably,
my superior in certain physical powers, without which I would
have perished!</p>

<p>As the sun ascended in the sky, my wound became irritated
by exercise, and the inflammation produced a feverish torment
in which I groaned as I lay extended in the stern-sheets. By
noon a breeze sprang up from the south-west, so that the oars
and table-cloth supplied a square sail which wafted us about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
three miles an hour, while my boy rigged an awning with the
blankets and boat-hooks. Thus, half reclining, I steered landward
till midnight, when I took in the sail and lay-to on the
calm ocean till morning. Next day the breeze again favored us;
and, by sundown, I came up with the coasting canoe of a friendly
Mandingo, into which I at once exchanged my quarters, and falling
asleep, never stirred till he landed me on the Islands de
Loss.</p>

<p>My wound kept me a close and suffering prisoner in a hut on
the isles for ten days during which I despatched a native canoe
some thirty five or forty miles to the Rio Pongo with news of my
disaster, and orders for a boat with an equipment of comforts.
As my clerk neglected to send a suit of clothes, I was obliged to
wear the Mandingo habiliments till I reached my factory, so
that during my transit, this dress became the means of an odd
encounter. As I entered the Rio Pongo, a French brigantine
near the bar was the first welcome of civilization that cheered
my heart for near a fortnight. Passing her closely, I drifted
alongside, and begged the commander for a bottle of claret. My
brown skin, African raiment, and savage companions satisfied the
skipper that I was a native, so that, with a sneer, he, of course,
became very solicitous to know &ldquo;where I drank claret <i>last</i>?&rdquo;
and pointing to the sea, desired me to quench my thirst with
brine!</p>

<p>It was rather hard for a suffering Italian to be treated so
cavalierly by a Gaul; but I thanked the fellow for his civility in
such excellent French, that his tone instantly changed, and he
asked&mdash;&ldquo;<i>au nom de Dieu</i>, where I had learned the language!&rdquo;
It is likely I would have rowed off without detection, had I not
just then been recognized by one of his officers who visited my
factory the year before.</p>

<p>In a moment the captain was in my boat with a bound, and
grasping my hands with a thousand pardons, insisted I should not
ascend the river till I had dined with him. He promised a plate
of capital soup;&mdash;and where, I should like to know, is the son of
France or Italy who is ready to withstand the seduction of such
a provocative? Besides this, he insisted on dressing me from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg&nbsp;220]</a></span>
his scanty wardrobe; but as he declined all subsequent remuneration,
I confined my bodily improvement to a clean shirt and his
wiry razors.</p>

<p>While the <i>bouillon</i> was bubbling in the coppers, I got an insight
into the condition of Rio Pongo concerns since my departure.
The Dane was off after a quarrel with Ormond, who gave him but a
hundred negroes for his cargo; and a Spanish brig was waiting
my arrival,&mdash;for the boy I sent home from the Isles de Loss had
reported my engagement, capture, and escape.</p>

<p><i>La soupe sur la table</i>, we attacked a smoking tureen of <i>bouillon
gras</i>, while a heaping dish of toasted bread stood in the middle.
The captain loaded my plate with two slices of this sunburnt material,
which he deluged with a couple of ladles of savory broth.
A long fast is a good sauce, and I need not assert that I began
<i>sans fa&ccedil;on</i>. My appetite was sharp, and the vapor of the liquid
inviting. For a while there was a dead silence, save when
broken by smacking and relishing lips. Spoonful after spoonful
was sucked in as rapidly as the heat allowed; and, indeed, I
hardly took time to bestow a blessing on the cook. Being the
guest of the day, my plate had been the first one served, and
of course, was the first one finished. Perhaps I rather hurried
myself, for lenten diet made me greedy and I was somewhat anxious
to anticipate the calls of my companions on the tureen. Accordingly,
I once more ballasted my plate with toast, and, with
a charming bow and a civil &ldquo;<i>s&rsquo;il vous plait</i>,&rdquo; applied, like Oliver
Twist, &ldquo;for more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the captain was helping me to the second ladle, he politely
demanded whether I was &ldquo;fond of the thick;&rdquo; and as I
replied in the affirmative, he made another dive to the bottom
and brought up the instrument with a heaping mass in whose centre
was a diminutive African skull, face upwards, gaping at the
guests with an infernal grin!</p>

<p>My plate fell from my hand at the tureen&rsquo;s edge. The boiling
liquid splashed over the table. I stood fascinated by the horrible
apparition as the captain continued to hold its dreadful
bones in view. Presently my head swam; a painful oppression
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg&nbsp;221]</a></span>
weighed at my heart; I was ill; and, in a jiffy, the appalling
spectre was laid beneath the calm waters of the Rio Pongo.</p>

<p>Before sundown I made a speedy retreat from among the
<i>anthropophagi</i>; but all their assurances, oaths, and protestations,
could not satisfy me that the broth did not owe its substance
to something more human than an African <i>baboon</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>


<p>There was rejoicing that night in Kambia among my people,
for it is not necessary that a despised slaver should always be
a cruel master. I had many a friend among the villagers, both
there and at Bangalang, and when the &ldquo;barker&rdquo; came from the
Isles <i>de Loss</i> with the news of my capture and misery, the settlement
had been keenly astir until it was known that Mongo T&eacute;odore
was safe and sound among his protectors.</p>

<p>I had a deep, refreshing sleep after a glorious bath. Poor
Esther stole over the palisades of Bangalang to hear the story
from my own lips; and, in recompense for the narrative, gave
me an account of the river gossip during my adventure. Next
morning, bright and early, I was again in my boat, sweeping
along towards the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Feliz</span>&rdquo; from Matanzas, which was anchored
within a bowshot of Bangalang. As I rounded a point in sight
of her, the Spanish flag was run up, and as I touched the deck,
a dozen cheers and a gun gave token of a gallant reception in
consequence of my battle with the British, which had been magnified
into a perfect Trafalgar.</p>

<p>The Feliz was originally consigned to me from Cuba, but in
my absence from the river her commander thought it best not to
intrust so important a charge to my clerk, and addressed her to
Ormond. When my arrival at the Isles <i>de Loss</i> was announced
on the river, his engagement with the Mongo had neither been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg&nbsp;223]</a></span>
entirely completed, nor had any cargo been delivered. Accordingly,
the skipper at once taxed his wit for a contrivance by which
he could escape the bargain. In Africa such things are sometimes
done with ease on small pretexts, so that when I reached
Kambia my one-hundred-and-forty-ton brig was ready for her original
consignee.</p>

<p>I found that remittances in money and merchandise covered
the value of three hundred and fifty slaves, whom I quickly ordered
from different traders;&mdash;but when I applied to the Mongo
to furnish his share, the gentleman indignantly refused under the
affront of his recalled assignment. I tried to pacify and persuade
him; yet all my efforts were unavailing. Still, the results of this
denial did not affect the Mongo personally and alone. When a
factor either declines or is unable to procure trade at an African
station, the multitude of hangers-on, ragamuffins, servants and
villagers around him suffer, at least, for a time. They cannot understand
and are always disgusted when &ldquo;trade is refused.&rdquo; In
this case the people of Bangalang seemed peculiarly dissatisfied
with their Mongo&rsquo;s obstinacy. They accused him of indolent disregard
of their interests. They charged him with culpable neglect.
Several free families departed forthwith to Kambia. His
brothers, who were always material sufferers in such cases, upbraided
him with arrogant conceit. His women, headed by Fatimah,&mdash;who
supplied herself and her companions with abundant
presents out of every fresh cargo,&mdash;rose in open mutiny, and declared
they would run off unless he accepted a share of the contract.
Fatimah was the orator of the harem on this as well as
on all other occasions of display or grievance, and of course she
did not spare poor Ormond. Age and drunkenness had made sad
inroads on his constitution and looks during the last half year.
His fretful irritability sometimes amounted almost to madness,
when thirty female tongues joined in the chorus of their leader&rsquo;s
assault. They boldly charged him, singly and in pairs, with every
vice and fault that injured matrimony habitually denounces; and as
each item of this abusive litany was screamed in his ears, the chorus
responded with a deep &ldquo;amen!&rdquo; They boasted of their infidelities,
lauded their lovers, and producing their children, with
laughs of derision, bade him note the astounding resemblance!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg&nbsp;224]</a></span>
The poor Mongo was sorely beset by these African witches,
and summoned his villagers to subdue the revolt; but many of
the town-folks were pets of the girls, so that no one came forth to
obey his bidding.</p>

<p>I visited Ormond at his request on the evening of this rebellion,
and found him not only smarting with the morning&rsquo;s insult,
but so drunk as to be incapable of business. His revengeful eye
and nervous movements denoted a troubled mind. When our
hands met, I found the Mongo&rsquo;s cold and clammy. I refused
wine under a plea of illness; and when, with incoherent phrases
and distracted gestures, he declared his willingness to retract
his refusal and accept a share of the Felix&rsquo;s cargo, I thought it
best to adjourn the discussion until the following day. Whilst
on the point of embarking, I was joined by the faithless servant,
whom I bribed to aid me in my affair with the Dane, and was
told that Ormond <i>had drugged the wine in anticipation of my
arrival</i>! He bade me be wary of the Mongo, who in his presence
had threatened my life. That morning, he said, while the
women were upbraiding him, my name had been mentioned by
one with peculiar favor,&mdash;when Ormond burst forth with a torrent
of passion, and accusing me as the cause of all his troubles,
felled the girl to the earth with his fist.</p>

<p>That night I was roused by my watchman to see a stranger,
and found Esther at my gate with three of her companions.
Their tale was brief. Soon after dark, Ormond entered the
harem with loaded pistol, in search of Fatimah and Esther;
but the wretch was so stupefied by liquor and rage, that the
women had little trouble to elude his grasp and escape from
Bangalang. Hardly had I bestowed them for the night, when
another alarm brought the watchman once more to my chamber,
with the news of Ormond&rsquo;s death. He had shot himself through
the heart!</p>

<p>I was in no mood for sleep after this, and the first streak of
dawn found me at Bangalang. There lay the Mongo as he fell.
No one disturbed his limbs or approached him till I arrived.
He never stirred after the death-wound.</p>

<p>It seems he must have forgotten that the bottle had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg&nbsp;225]</a></span>
been specially medicated for me, as it was found nearly drained;
but the last thing distinctly known of him by the people, was his
murderous entrance into the harem to despatch Esther and Fatimah.
Soon after this the crack of a pistol was heard in the garden;
and there, stretched among the cassava plants, with a loaded
pistol grasped in his left, and a discharged one at a short distance
from his right hand, laid Jack Ormond, the mulatto! His
left breast was pierced by a ball, the wad of which still clung to
the bloody orifice.</p>

<p>Bad as this man was, I could not avoid a sigh for his death.
He had been my first friend in Africa, and I had forfeited his
regard through no fault of mine. Besides this, there are so few
on the coast of Africa in these lonely settlements among the
mangrove swamps, who have tasted European civilization, and
can converse like human beings, that the loss even of the worst
is a dire calamity. Ormond and myself had held each other for
a long time at a wary distance; yet business forced us together
now and then, and during the truce, we had many a pleasant chat
and joyous hour that would henceforth be lost for ever.</p>

<p>It is customary in this part of Africa to make the burial of a
<i>Mongo</i> the occasion of a <i>colungee</i>, or festival, when all the neighboring
chiefs and relations send gifts of food and beverage for
the orgies of death. Messengers had been despatched for Ormond&rsquo;s
brothers and kinsfolk, so that the native ceremony of interment
was postponed till the third day; and, in the interval, I
was desired to make all the preparations in a style befitting the
suicide&rsquo;s station. Accordingly, I issued the needful orders;
directed a deep grave to be dug under a noble cotton-wood tree,
aloof from the village; gave the body in charge to women, who
were to watch it until burial, with cries of sorrow,&mdash;and then
retired to Kambia.</p>

<p>On the day of obsequies I came back. At noon a salute was
fired by the guns of the village, which was answered by minute
guns from the Feliz and my factory. Seldom have I heard a
sadder sound than the boom of those cannons through the silent
forest and over the waveless water.</p>

<p>Presently, all the neighboring chiefs, princes and kings came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg&nbsp;226]</a></span>
in with their retainers, when the body was brought out into the
shade of a grove, so that all might behold it. Then the procession
took up its line of march, while the thirty wives of the
Mongo followed the coffin, clad in rags, their heads shaven, their
bodies lacerated with burning iron, and filling the air with yells
and shrieks until the senseless clay was laid in the grave.</p>

<p>I could find no English prayer-book or Bible in the village,
from which I might read the service of his church over Ormond&rsquo;s
remains, but I had never forgotten the <i>Ave Maria</i> and <i>Pater
Noster</i> I learned when an infant, and, while I recited them
devoutly over the self murderer, I could not help thinking they
were even more than sufficient for the savage surroundings.</p>

<p>The brief prayer was uttered; but it could not be too brief
for the impatient crowd. Its <i>amen</i> was a signal for <i>pandemonium</i>.
In a twinkling, every foot rushed back to the dwelling
in Bangalang. The grove was alive with revelry. Stakes
and rocks reeked with roasting bullocks. Here and there, kettles
steamed with boiling rice. Demijohn after demijohn of
<i>rum</i>, was served out. Very soon a sham battle was proposed,
and parties were formed. The divisions took their grounds;
and, presently, the scouts appeared, crawling like reptiles on the
earth till they ascertained each other&rsquo;s position, when the armies
rallied forth with guns, bows, arrows, or lances, and, after firing,
shrieking and shouting till they were deaf, retired with captives,
and the war was done. Then came a reinforcement of rum, and
then a dance, so that the bewildering revel continued in all its
delirium till rum and humanity gave out together, and reeled to
the earth in drunken sleep! Such was the requiem of</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Mongo of Bangalang!</span></p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg&nbsp;227]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>


<p>Slaves dropped in slowly at Kambia and Bangalang, though I
still had half the cargo of the Feliz to make up. Time was
precious, and there was no foreigner on the river to aid me. In
this strait, I suddenly resolved on a foray among the natives on
my own account; and equipping a couple of my largest canoes
with an ample armament, as well as a substantial store of provisions
and merchandise, I departed for the Matacan river, a
short stream, unsuitable for vessels of considerable draft. I was
prepared for the purchase of fifty slaves.</p>

<p>I reached my destination without risk or adventure, but had
the opportunity of seeing some new phases of Africanism on my
arrival. Most of the coast negroes are wretchedly degraded by
their superstitions and <i>sauvagerie</i>, and it is best to go among
them with power to resist as well as presents to purchase. Their
towns did not vary from the river and bush settlements generally.
A house was given me for my companions and merchandise;
yet such was the curiosity to see the &ldquo;white man,&rdquo; that
the luckless mansion swarmed with sable bees both inside and
out, till I was obliged to send for his majesty to relieve my sufferings.</p>

<p>After a proper delay, the king made his appearance in all the
paraphernalia of African court-dress. A few fathoms of check
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg&nbsp;228]</a></span>
girded his loins, while a blue shirt and red waistcoat were surmounted
by a dragoon&rsquo;s cap with brass ornaments. His countenance
was characteristic of Ethiopia and royalty. A narrow
forehead retreated rapidly till it was lost in the crisp wool, while
his eyes were wide apart, and his prominent cheek-bones formed
the base of an inverted cone, the apex of which was his braided
beard, coiled up under his chin. When earnest in talk, his gestures
were mostly made with his head, by straining his eyes to
the rim of their sockets, stretching his mouth from ear to ear,
grinning like a baboon, and throwing out his chin horizontally
with a sudden jerk. Notwithstanding these personal oddities,
the sovereign was kind, courteous, hospitable, and disposed for
trade. Accordingly, I &ldquo;dashed,&rdquo; or presented him and his
head-men a few pieces of cottons, with some pipes, beads, and
looking-glasses, by way of whet for the appetite of to-morrow.</p>

<p>But the division of this gift was no sportive matter. &ldquo;The
spoils&rdquo; were not regulated upon principles of superiority, or even
of equality; but fell to the lot of the stoutest scramblers. As
soon as the goods were deposited, the various gangs seized my
snowy cottons, dragging them right and left to their several huts,
while they shrieked, yelled, disputed, and fought in true African
fashion. Some lucky dog would now and then leap between two
combatants who had possession of the ends of a piece, and whirling
himself rapidly around the middle, slashed the sides with
his jack-knife and was off to the bush. The pipes, beads, and
looking-glasses, were not bestowed more tenderly, while the tobacco
was grabbed and appropriated by leaves or handfuls.</p>

<p>Next day we proceeded to formal business. His majesty
called a regular &ldquo;palaver&rdquo; of his chiefs and head-men, before
whom I stated my <i>dantica</i> and announced the terms. Very
soon several young folks were brought for sale, who, I am sure,
never dreamed at rising from last night&rsquo;s sleep, that they were
destined for Cuban slavery! My merchandise revived the memory
of peccadilloes that had been long forgotten, and sentences
that were forgiven. Jealous husbands, when they tasted my rum,
suddenly remembered their wives&rsquo; infidelities, and sold their better
halves for more of the oblivious fluid. In truth I was exalted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg&nbsp;229]</a></span>
into a magician, unroofing the village, and baring its crime
and wickedness to the eye of <i>justice</i>. Law became profitable,
and virtue had never reached so high a price! Before night the
town was in a turmoil, for every man cudgelled his brain for an
excuse to kidnap his neighbor, so as to share my commerce. As
the village was too small to supply the entire gang of fifty, I had
recourse to the neighboring settlements, where my &ldquo;barkers,&rdquo; or
agents, did their work in a masterly manner. Traps were
adroitly baited with goods to lead the unwary into temptation,
when the unconscious pilferer was caught by his ambushed foe,
and an hour served to hurry him to the beach as a slave for ever.
In fact, five days were sufficient to stamp my image permanently
on the Matacan settlements, and to associate my memory with
any thing but blessings in at least fifty of their families!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I had heard, on the Rio Pongo, of a wonderful wizard who
dwelt in this region, and took advantage of the last day of my detention
to inquire his whereabouts. The impostor was renowned
for his wonderful tricks of legerdemain, as well as for cures, necromancy,
and fortune-telling. The ill came to him by scores;
credulous warriors approached him with valuable gifts for <i>fetiches</i>
against musket balls and arrows; while the humbler classes
bought his charms against snakes, alligators, sharks, evil spirits,
or sought his protection for their unborn children.</p>

<p>My interpreter had already visited this fellow, and gave such
charming accounts of his skill, that all my people wanted their
fates divined, for which I was, of course, obliged to advance merchandise
to purchase at least a gratified curiosity. When they
came back I found every one satisfied with his future lot, and
so happy was the chief of my Kroomen that he danced around
his new <i>fetiche</i> of cock&rsquo;s feathers and sticks, and snapped his
fingers at all the sharks, alligators, and swordfish that swam in
the sea.</p>

<p>By degrees these reports tickled my own curiosity to such a
degree, that, incontinently, I armed myself with a quantity of
cotton cloth, a brilliant bandanna, and a lot of tobacco, wherewith
I resolved to attack the soothsayer&rsquo;s den. My credulity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg&nbsp;230]</a></span>
was not involved to the expedition, but I was sincerely anxious
to comprehend the ingenuity or intelligence by which a negro
could control the imagination of African multitudes.</p>

<p>The wizard chose his abode with skilful and romantic taste.
Quitting the town by a path which ascended abruptly from the
river, the traveller was forced to climb the steep by a series of
dangerous zig-zags among rocks and bushes, until he reached a
deep cave in an elevated cliff that bent over the stream. As we
approached, my conductor warned the inmate of our coming by
several whoops. When we reached the entrance I was directed
to halt until the demon announced his willingness to receive us.
At length, after as much delay as is required in the antechamber
of a secretary of state, a growl, like the cry of a hungry crocodile,
gave token of the wizard&rsquo;s coming.</p>

<p>As he emerged from the deep interior, I descried an uncommonly
tall figure, bearing in his arms a young and living leopard.
I could not detect a single lineament of his face or figure, for he
was covered from head to foot in a complete dress of monkey
skins, while his face was hidden by a grotesque white mask.
Behind him groped a delicate blind boy.</p>

<p>We seated ourselves on hides along the floor, when, at my bidding,
the interpreter, unrolling my gifts, announced that I came
with full hands to his wizardship, for the purpose of learning my
fortune.</p>

<p>The impostor had trained his tame leopard to fetch and carry
like a dog, so that, without a word, the docile beast bore the various
presents to his master. Every thing was duly measured,
examined, or balanced in his hands to ascertain its quality and
weight. Then, placing a bamboo between his lips and the blind
boy&rsquo;s ear, he whispered the words which the child repeated
aloud. First of all, he inquired what I wished to know? As
one of his follower&rsquo;s boasts was the extraordinary power he possessed
of speaking various languages, I addressed him in Spanish,
but as his reply displayed an evident ignorance of what I
said, I took the liberty to reprimand him sharply in his native
tongue. He waved me off with an imperious flourish of his
hand, and ordered me to wait, as he perfectly comprehended my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg&nbsp;231]</a></span>
Spanish, but the magic power would not suffer him to answer
save in regular rotation, word by word.</p>

<p>I saw his trick at once, which was only one of prompt and
adroit <i>repetition</i>. Accordingly, I addressed him in his native
dialect, and requested a translation of my sentence into Spanish.
But this was a puzzler; though it required but a moment for
him to assure me that a foreign language could only be spoken
by wizards of his degree <i>at the full of the moon</i>!</p>

<p>I thought it time to shift the scene to fortune-telling, and
begged my demon to begin the task by relating the past, in order
to confirm my belief in his mastery over the future. But the
nonsense he uttered was so insufferable, that I dropped the curtain
with a run, and commanded &ldquo;the hereafter&rdquo; to appear.
This, at least, was more romantic. As usual, I was to be immensely
rich. I was to become a great prince. I was to have a
hundred wives; but alas! before six months elapsed, my factory
would be burnt and I should lose a vessel!</p>

<p>Presently, the interpreter proposed an exhibition of legerdemain,
and in this I found considerable amusement to make up
for the preceding buffoonery. He knotted a rope, and untied it
with a jerk. He sank a knife deep in his throat, and poured in
a vessel of water. Other deceptions followed this skilful trick,
but the cleverest of all was the handling of red hot iron, which,
after covering his hands with a glutinous paste, was touched in
the most fearless manner. I have seen this trick performed by
other natives, and whenever ignited coals or ardent metal was
used, the hands of the operator were copiously anointed with the
pasty unguent.</p>

<p>A valedictory growl, and a resumption of the leopard, gave
token of the wizard&rsquo;s departure, and closed the evening&rsquo;s entertainments.</p>

<p>If the ease with which a man is amused, surprised, or deluded,
is a fair measure of intellectual grade, I fear that African
minds will take a very moderate rank in the scale of humanity.
The task of self-civilization, which resembles the self-filtering of
water, has done but little for Ethiopia in the ages that have
passed simultaneously over her people and the progressive races
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg&nbsp;232]</a></span>
of other lands. It remains to be seen what the <i>infused</i> civilization
of Christianity and Islamism will effect among these benighted
nations. <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, <span class="smcap">Mahomet</span>, and the <span class="smcap">Fetiche</span>, will, perhaps,
long continue to be their types of distinctive separation.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg&nbsp;233]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>


<p>The Esperanza&rsquo;s capture made it absolutely necessary that I
should visit Cuba, so that, when the Feliz was preparing to depart,
I began to put my factory and affairs in such order as would
enable me to embark in her and leave me master of myself for a
considerable time. I may as well record the fact here that the
unlucky Esperanza was sent to Sierra Leone, where she was, of
course, condemned as a slaver, while the officers and crew were
despatched by order of the Admiralty, in irons, to <i>Lisbon</i>, where
a tribunal condemned them to the galleys for five years. I understand
they were subsequently released by the clemency of
Don Pedro de Braganza when he arrived from Brazil.</p>

<p>Every thing was ready for our departure. My rice was stored
and about to be sent on board; when, about three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning of the 25th of May, 1828, the voice of my servant
roused me from pleasant dreams, to fly for life! I sprang from
the cot with a bound to the door, where the flickering of a bright
flame, reflected through the thick, misty air, gave token of fire.
The roof of my house was in a blaze, and one hundred and fifty
kegs of powder were close at hand beneath a thatch! They
could not be removed, and a single spark from the frail and
tinder-like materials might send the whole in an instant to
the skies.</p>

<p>A rapid discharge from a double-barrelled gun brought my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg&nbsp;234]</a></span>
people to the spot with alacrity, and enabled me to rescue the
two hundred and twenty slaves stowed in the <i>barracoon</i>, and
march them to a neighboring wood, where they would be secure under
a guard. In my haste to rescue the slaves I forgot to warn
my body-servant of his peril from the powder. The faithful boy
made several trips to the dwelling to save my personal effects,
and after removing every thing he had strength to carry, returned
to unchain the bloodhound that always slept beside my couch
in Africa. But the dog was as ignorant of his danger as the
youth. <i>He knew no friend but myself</i>, and tearing the hand
that was exposed to save him, he forced his rescuer to fly. And
well was it he did so. Within a minute, a tremendous blast
shook the earth, <i>and the prediction of the Matacan wizard was
accomplished</i>! Not even the red coals of my dwelling smouldered
on the earth. Every thing was swept as by the breath
of a whirlwind. My terrified boy, bleeding at nose and ears, was
rescued from the ruins of a shallow well in which he fortunately
fell. The bamboo sheds, barracoons, and hovels,&mdash;the <i>adobe</i>
dwelling and the comfortable garden&mdash;could all spring up again
in a short time, as if by enchantment,&mdash;but my rich stuffs, my
cottons, my provisions, my arms, my ammunition, my capital,
were dust.</p>

<p>In a few hours, friends crowded round me, according to African
custom, with proffered services to rebuild my establishment;
but the heaviest loss I experienced was that of the rice designed
for the voyage, which I could not replace in consequence of the
destruction of my merchandise. In my difficulty, I was finally
obliged to swap some of my two hundred and twenty negroes for
the desired commodity, which enabled me to despatch the Feliz,
though I was, of course, obliged to abandon the voyage in her.</p>

<p>My mind was greatly exercised for some time in endeavors
to discover the origin of this conflagration. The blaze was first
observed at the top of one of the gable ends, which satisfied Ali-Ninpha
as well as myself that it was the work of a malicious
incendiary. We adopted a variety of methods to trace or trap
the scoundrel, but our efforts were fruitless, until a strange negro
exhibited one of my double-barrelled guns for sale at a neighboring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg&nbsp;235]</a></span>
village, whose chief happened to recognize it. When the
seller was questioned about his possession of the weapon, he
alleged that it was purchased from inland negroes in a distant
town. His replies were so unsatisfactory to the inquisitive
chief, that he arrested the suspected felon and sent him to
Kambia.</p>

<p>I had but little remorse in adopting any means in my power
to extort a confession from the negro, who very soon admitted
that my gun was stolen by a runner from the wizard of Matacan,
who was still hanging about the outskirts of our settlement. I
offered a liberal reward and handsome bribes to get possession
of the necromancer himself, but such was the superstitious awe
surrounding his haunt, that no one dared venture to seize him in
his sanctuary, or seduce him within reach of my revenge. This,
however, was not the case in regard to his emissary. I was soon
in possession of the actual thief, and had little difficulty in
securing his execution on the ruins he had made. Before we
launched him into eternity, I obtained his confession after an
obstinate resistance, and found with considerable pain that a
brother of Ormond, the suicide, was a principal mover in the
affair. The last words of the Mongo had been reported to this
fellow as an injunction of revenge against me, and he very soon
learned from personal experience that Kambia was a serious
rival, if not antagonist, to Bangalang. His African simplicity
made him believe that the &ldquo;red cock&rdquo; on my roof-tree would
expel me from the river. I was not in a position to pay him
back at the moment, yet I made a vow to give the new Mongo a
free passage in irons to Cuba before many moons. But this,
like other rash promises, I never kept.</p>

<p>Sad as was the wreck of my property, the conflagration was
fraught with a misfortune that affected my heart far more deeply
than the loss of merchandise. Ever since the day of my landing
at Ormond&rsquo;s factory, a gentle form had flitted like a fairy among
my fortunes, and always as the minister of kindness and hope.
Skilled in the ways of her double blood, she was my discreet
counsellor in many a peril; and, tender as a well-bred dame of
civilized lands, she was ever disposed to promote my happiness by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg&nbsp;236]</a></span>
disinterested offices. But, when we came to number the survivors
of the ruin, <span class="smcap">Esther</span> was nowhere to be found, nor could I
ever trace, among the scattered fragments, the slightest relic of
the Pariah&rsquo;s form!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Of course, I had very little beside my domestics to leave in
charge of any one at Kambia, and intrusting them to the care
of Ali-Ninpha, I went in my launch to Sierra Leone, where I
purchased a schooner that had been condemned by the Mixed
Commission.</p>

<p>In 1829, vessels were publicly sold, and, with very little
trouble, equipped for the coast of Africa. The captures in that
region were somewhat like playing a hand,&mdash;taking the tricks,
reshuffling the same cards, and dealing again to take more tricks!
Accordingly, I fitted the schooner to receive a cargo of negroes
immediately on quitting port. My crew was made up of men
from all nations, captured in prizes; but I guardedly selected
my officers from Spaniards exclusively.</p>

<p>We were slowly wafting along the sea, a day or two out of
the British colony, when the mate fell into chat with a clever
lad, who was hanging lazily over the helm. They spoke of voyages
and mishaps, and this led the sailor to declare his recent
escape from a vessel, then in the Rio Nunez, whose mate had
poisoned the commander to get possession of the craft. She
had been fitted, he said, at St. Thomas with the feigned design
of coasting; but, when she sailed for Africa, her register was
sent back to the island in a boat to serve some other vessel, while
she ventured to the continent <i>without</i> papers.</p>

<p>I have cause to believe that the slave-trade was rarely conducted
upon the honorable principles between man and man,
which, of course, are the only security betwixt owners, commanders
and consignees whose commerce is exclusively contraband.
There were men, it is true, engaged in it, with whom the &ldquo;point
of honor&rdquo; was more omnipotent than the dread of law in regular
trade. But innumerable cases have occurred in which the spendthrifts
who appropriated their owners&rsquo; property on the coast of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg&nbsp;237]</a></span>
Africa, availed themselves of such superior force as they happened
to control, in order to escape detection, or assure a favorable
reception in the West Indies. In fact, the slaver sometimes
ripened into something very like a pirate!</p>

<p>In 1828 and 1829, severe engagements took place between
Spanish slavers and this class of contrabandists. Spaniards
would assail Portuguese when the occasion was tempting and
propitious. Many a vessel has been fitted in Cuba for these
adventures, and returned to port with a living cargo, purchased
by cannon-balls and boarding-pikes exclusively.</p>

<p>Now, I confess that my notions had become at this epoch
somewhat relaxed by my traffic on the coast, so that I grew to be
no better than folks of my cloth. I was fond of excitement;
my craft was sadly in want of a cargo; and, as the mate narrated
the helmsman&rsquo;s story, the Quixotic idea naturally got control of
my brain that I was destined to become the <i>avenger</i> of the
poisoned captain. I will not say that I was altogether stimulated
by the noble spirit of justice; for it is quite possible I
would never have thought of the dead man had not the sailor
apprised us that his vessel was half full of negroes!</p>

<p>As we drifted slowly by the mouth of my old river, I slipped
over the bar, and, while I fitted the schooner with a splendid
nine-pounder amidships, I despatched a spy to the Rio Nunez to
report the facts about the poisoning, as well as the armament of
the unregistered slaver. In ten days the runner verified the
tale. She was still in the stream, with one hundred and eighty-five
human beings in her hold, but would soon be off with an
entire cargo of two hundred and twenty-five.</p>

<p>The time was extraordinarily propitious. Every thing favored
my enterprise. The number of slaves would exactly fit my
schooner. Such a windfall could not be neglected; and, on the
fourth day, I was entering the Rio Nunez under the Portuguese
flag, which I unfurled by virtue of a pass from Sierra Leone to
the Cape de Verd Islands.</p>

<p>I cannot tell whether my spy had been faithless, but when I
reached Furcaria, I perceived that my game had taken wing
from her anchorage. Here was a sad disappointment. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg&nbsp;238]</a></span>
schooner drew too much water to allow a further ascent, and,
moreover, I was unacquainted with the river.</p>

<p>As it was important that I should keep aloof from strangers,
I anchored in a quiet spot, and seizing the first canoe that passed,
learned, for a small reward, that the object of my search was
hidden in a bend of the river at the king&rsquo;s town of Kakundy,
which I could not reach without the pilotage of a certain mulatto,
who was alone fit for the enterprise.</p>

<p>I knew this half-breed as soon as his person was described,
but I had little hope of securing his services, either by fair means
or promised recompense. He owed me five slaves for dealings
that took place between us at Kambia, and had always refused
so strenuously to pay, that I felt sure he would be off to the
woods as soon as he knew my presence on the river. Accordingly,
I kept my canoemen on the schooner by an abundant supply
of &ldquo;bitters,&rdquo; and at midnight landed half a dozen, who proceeded
to the mulatto&rsquo;s cabin, where he was seized <i>sans ceremonie</i>.
The terror of this ruffian was indescribable when he found
himself in my presence,&mdash;a captive, as he supposed, for the debt
of flesh. But I soon relieved him, and offered a liberal reward
for his prompt, secret and safe pilotage, to Kakundy. The mulatto
was willing, but the stream was too shallow for my keel.
He argued the point so convincingly, that in half an hour, I
relinquished the attempt, and resolved to make &ldquo;Mahomet come
to the mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two boats were quickly manned, armed, and supplied
with lanterns; and, with muffled oars, guided by our pilot,&mdash;whose
skull was kept constantly under the lee of my pistols&mdash;we
fell like vampyres on our prey in the darkness.</p>

<p>With a wild hurrah and a blaze of our pistols in the air, we
leaped on board, driving every soul under hatches without striking
a blow! Sentries were placed at the cabin door, forecastle
and hatchway. The cable was slipped, my launch took her in
tow, the pilot and myself took charge of the helm, and, before
daylight, the prize was alongside my schooner, transhipping one
hundred and ninety-seven of her slaves, with their necessary
supplies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg&nbsp;239]</a></span>
Great was the surprise of the captured crew when they saw
their fate; and great was the agony of the poisoner, when he
returned next morning to the vacant anchorage, after a night of
debauch with the king of Kakundy. First of all, he imagined
we were regular cruisers, and that the captain&rsquo;s death was about
to be avenged. But when it was discovered that they had fallen
into the grasp of <i>friendly slavers</i>, five of his seamen abandoned
their craft and shipped with me.</p>

<p>We had capital stomachs for breakfast after the night&rsquo;s
romance. Hardly was it swallowed, however, when three canoes
came blustering down the stream, filled with negroes and headed
by his majesty. I did not wait for a salutation, but, giving the
warriors a dose of bellicose grape, tripped my anchor, sheeted
home my sails, and was off like an albatross!</p>

<p>The feat was cleverly achieved; but, since then, I have very
often been taxed by my conscience with doubts as to its strict
morality! The African slave-trade produces singular notions of
<i>meum and tuum</i> in the minds and hearts of those who dwell
for any length of time on that blighting coast; and it is not
unlikely that I was quite as prone to the infection as better men,
who perished under the malady, while I escaped!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>


<p>It was a sweltering July, and the &ldquo;rainy season&rdquo; proved its
tremendous power by almost incessant deluges. In the breathless
calms that held me spell-bound on the coast, the rain came
down in such torrents that I often thought the solid water would
bury and submerge our schooner. Now and then, a south-wester
and the current would fan and drift us along; yet the tenth day
found us rolling from side to side in the longitude of the Cape
de Verds.</p>

<p>Day broke with one of its customary squalls and showers.
As the cloud lifted, my look-out from the cross-trees announced
a sail under our lee. It was invisible from deck, in the folds of
the retreatingmain, but, in the dead calm that followed, the distant
whistle of a boatswain was distinctly audible. Before I
could deliberate all my doubts were solved by a shot in our mainsail,
and the crack of a cannon. There could be no question that
the unwelcome visitor was a man-of-war.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the breeze sprang up after the lull, and
enabled us to carry every thing that could be crowded on our
spars. We dashed away before the freshening wind, like a deer
with the unleashed hounds pursuing. The slaves were shifted
from side to side&mdash;forward or aft&mdash;to aid our sailing. Head-stays
were slackened, wedges knocked off the masts, and every
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg&nbsp;241]</a></span>
incumbrance cast from the decks into the sea. Now and then, a
fruitless shot from his bow-chasers, reminded the fugitive that
the foe was still on his scent. At last, the cruiser got the
range of his guns so perfectly, that a well-aimed ball ripped
away our rail and tore a dangerous splinter from the foremast,
three feet from deck. It was now perilous to carry a press of
sail on the same tack with the weakened spar, whereupon I put
the schooner about, and, to my delight, found we ranged ahead
a knot faster on this course than the former. The enemy &ldquo;went
about&rdquo; as quickly as we did, but her balls soon fell short of us,
and, before noon, we had crawled so nimbly to windward, that
her top-gallants alone were visible above the horizon.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Our voyage was uncheckered by any occurrence worthy of
recollection, save the accidental loss of the mate in a dark and
stormy night, until we approached the Antilles. Here, where
every thing on a slaver assumes the guise of pleasure and relief,
I remarked not only the sullenness of my crew, but a disposition
to disobey or neglect. The second mate,&mdash;shipped in the Rio
Nunez, and who replaced my lost officer,&mdash;was noticed occasionally
in close intercourse with the watch, while his deportment
indicated dissatisfaction, if not mutiny.</p>

<p>A slaver&rsquo;s life on shore, as well as at sea, makes him wary
when another would not be circumspect, or even apprehensive.
The sight of land is commonly the signal for merriment, for a
well-behaved cargo is invariably released from shackles, and
allowed free intercourse between the sexes during daytime on
deck. Water tanks are thrown open for unrestricted use.
&ldquo;The cat&rdquo; is cast into the sea. Strict discipline is relaxed.
The day of danger or revolt is considered over, and the captain
enjoys a new and refreshing life till the hour of landing. Sailors,
with proverbial generosity, share their biscuits and clothing
with the blacks. The women, who are generally without garments,
appear in costume from the wardrobes of tars, petty officers,
mates, and even captains. Sheets, table-cloths, and spare
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg&nbsp;242]</a></span>
sails, are torn to pieces for raiment, while shoes, boots, caps, oilcloths,
and monkey-jackets, contribute to the gay masquerade of
the &ldquo;emigrants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was my sincere hope that the first glimpse of the Antilles
would have converted my schooner into a theatre for such a display;
but the moodiness of my companions was so manifest, that
I thought it best to meet rebellion half way, by breaking the suspected
officer, and sending him forward, at the same time that I
threw his &ldquo;dog-house&rdquo; overboard.<a name="FNanchor_4_9" id="FNanchor_4_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_9" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I was now without a reliable officer, and was obliged to call
two of the youngest sailors to my assistance in navigating the
schooner. I knew the cook and steward&mdash;both of whom messed
aft&mdash;to be trustworthy; so that, with four men at my back, and
the blacks below, I felt competent to control my vessel. From
that moment, I suffered no one to approach the quarter-deck
nearer than the mainmast.</p>

<p>It was a sweet afternoon when we were floating along the
shores of Porto Rico, tracking our course upon the chart.
Suddenly, one of my new assistants approached, with the sociability
common among Spaniards, and, in a quiet tone, asked
whether I would take a <i>cigarillo</i>. As I never smoked, I rejected
the offer with thanks, when the youth immediately dropped the
twisted paper on my map. In an instant, I perceived the <i>ruse</i>,
and discovered that the <i>cigarillo</i> was, in fact, a <i>billet</i> rolled to
resemble one. I put it in my mouth, and walked aft until I
could throw myself on the deck, with my head over the stern, so
as to open the paper unseen. It disclosed the organization of a
mutiny, under the lead of the broken mate. Our arrival in sight
of St. Domingo was to be the signal of its rupture, and for my
immediate landing on the island. Six of the crew were implicated
with the villain, and the boatswain, who was ill in the slave-hospital,
was to share my fate.</p>

<p>My resolution was promptly made. In a few minutes, I had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg&nbsp;243]</a></span>
cast a hasty glance into the arm-chest, and seen that our weapons
were in order. Then, mustering ten of the stoutest and cleverest
of my negroes on the quarter-deck, I took the liberty to
invent a little strategic fib, and told them, in the Soosoo dialect,
that there were bad men on board, who wanted to run the
schooner ashore among rocks and drown the slaves while below.
At the same time, I gave each a cutlass from the arm-chest, and
supplying my trusty whites with a couple of pistols and a knife
apiece, without saying a word, I seized the ringleader and his
colleagues! Irons and double-irons secured the party to the
mainmast or deck, while a drum-head court-martial, composed of
the officers, and presided over by myself, arraigned and tried the
scoundrels in much less time than regular boards ordinarily
spend in such investigations. During the inquiry, we ascertained
beyond doubt that the death of the mate was due to false play.
He had been wilfully murdered, as a preliminary to the assault
on me, for his colossal stature and powerful muscles would have
made him a dangerous adversary in the seizure of the craft.</p>

<p>There was, perhaps, a touch of the old-fashioned Inquisition
in the mode of our judicial researches concerning this projected
mutiny. We proceeded very much by way of &ldquo;confession,&rdquo;
and, whenever the culprit manifested reluctance or hesitation, his
memory was stimulated by a &ldquo;cat.&rdquo; Accordingly, at the end
of the trial, the mutineers were already pretty well punished; so
that we sentenced the six accomplices to receive an additional
flagellation, and continue ironed till we reached Cuba. But the
fate of the ringleader was not decided so easily. Some were in
favor of dropping him overboard, as he had done with the mate;
others proposed to set him adrift on a raft, ballasted with chains;
but I considered both these punishments too cruel, notwithstanding
his treachery, and kept his head beneath the pistol of a sentry
till I landed him in shackles on Turtle Island, with three
days food and abundance of water.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>


<p>After all these adventures, I was very near losing the schooner
before I got to land, by one of the perils of the sea, for which I
blame myself that I was not better prepared.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of a fine day. For some time, I had
noticed on the horizon a low bank of white cloud, which rapidly
spread itself over the sky and water, surrounding us with an impenetrable
fog. I apprehended danger; yet, before I could
make the schooner snug to meet the squall, a blast&mdash;as sudden
and loud as a thunderbolt&mdash;prostrated her nearly on her beam.
The shock was so violent and unforeseen, that the unrestrained
slaves, who were enjoying the fine weather on deck, rolled to leeward
till they floundered in the sea that inundated the scuppers.
There was no power in the tiller to &ldquo;keep her away&rdquo; before
the blast, for the rudder was almost out of water; but, fortunately,
our mainsail burst in shreds from the bolt-ropes, and,
relieving us from its pressure, allowed the schooner to right
under control of the helm. The West Indian squall abandoned
us as rapidly as it assailed, and I was happy to find that our
entire loss did not exceed two slave-children, who had been carelessly
suffered to sit on the rail.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>The reader knows that my voyage was an <i>impromptu</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg&nbsp;245]</a></span>
speculation, without papers, manifest, register, consignees, or destination.
It became necessary, therefore, that I should exercise a
very unusual degree of circumspection, not only in landing my
human cargo, but in selecting a spot from which I might communicate
with proper persons. I had never been in Cuba, save
on the occasion already described, nor were my business transactions
extended beyond the Regla association, by which I was
originally sent to Africa.</p>

<p>The day after the &ldquo;white squall&rdquo; I found our schooner drifting
with a leading breeze along the southern coast of Cuba, and
as the time seemed favorable, I thought I might as well cut the
Gordian knot of dilemma by landing my cargo in a secluded cove
that indented the beach about nine miles east of Sant&rsquo; Iago. If
I had been consigned to the spot, I could not have been more
fortunate in my reception. Some sixty yards from the landing
I found the comfortable home of a <i>ranchero</i> who proffered the
hospitality usual in such cases, and devoted a spacious barn to
the reception of my slaves while his family prepared an abundant
meal.</p>

<p>As soon as the cargo was safe from the grasp of cruisers, I
resolved to disregard the flagless and paperless craft that bore it
safely from Africa, and being unacquainted in Sant&rsquo; Iago, to
cross the island towards the capital, in search of a consignee.
Accordingly I mounted a spirited little horse, and with a <i>montero</i>
guide, turned my face once more towards the &ldquo;ever faithful
city of Havana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My companion had a thousand questions for &ldquo;the captain,&rdquo;
all of which I answered with so much <i>bonhommie</i>, that we soon
became the best friends imaginable, and chatted over all the
scandal of Cuba. I learned from this man that a cargo had recently
been &ldquo;run&rdquo; in the neighborhood of Matanzas, and that its
disposal was most successfully managed by a Se&ntilde;or * * *, from
Catalonia.</p>

<p>I slapped my thigh and shouted <i>eureka</i>! It flashed through
my mind to trust this man without further inquiry, and I confess
that my decision was based exclusively upon his <i>sectional</i> nationality.
I am partial to the Catalans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg&nbsp;246]</a></span>
Accordingly, I presented myself at the counting-room of my
future consignee in due time, and &ldquo;made a clean breast&rdquo; of the
whole transaction, disclosing the destitute state of my vessel. In
a very short period, his Excellency the Captain-General was made
aware of my arrival and furnished a list of &ldquo;the Africans,&rdquo;&mdash;by
which name the Bosal slaves are commonly known in Cuba.
Nor was the captain of the port neglected. A convenient blank
page of his register was inscribed with the name of my vessel as
having sailed from the port six months before, and this was backed
by a register and muster-roll, in order to secure my unquestionable
entry into a harbor.</p>

<p>Before nightfall every thing was in order with Spanish despatch
when stimulated either by doubloons or the smell of African
blood;&mdash;and twenty-four hours afterwards, I was again at
the landing with a suit of clothes and blanket for each of my
&ldquo;domestics.&rdquo; The schooner was immediately put in charge of a
clever pilot, who undertook the formal duty and <i>name</i> of her
commander, in order to elude the vigilance of all the minor officials
whose conscience had not been lulled by the golden
anodyne.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile every attention had been given to the slaves
by my hospitable <i>ranchero</i>. The &ldquo;head-money&rdquo; once paid, no
body,&mdash;civil, military, foreign, or Spanish&mdash;dared interfere with
them. Forty-eight hours of rest, ablution, exercise and feeding,
served to recruit the gang and steady their gait. Nor had the
sailors in charge of the party omitted the performance of their
duty as &ldquo;<i>valets</i>&rdquo; to the gentlemen and &ldquo;<i>ladies&rsquo; maids</i>&rdquo; to the
females; so that when the march towards Sant&rsquo; Iago began, the
procession might have been considered as &ldquo;respectable as it was
numerous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brokers of the southern emporium made very little delay
in finding purchasers at retail for the entire venture. The returns
were, of course, in cash; and so well did the enterprise
turn out, that I forgot the rebellion of our mutineers, and allowed
them to share my bounty with the rest of the crew. In fact,
so pleased was I with the result on inspecting the balance-sheet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg&nbsp;247]</a></span>
that I resolved to divert myself with the <i>dolce far niente</i> of Cuban
country life for a month at least.</p>

<p>But while I was making ready for this delightful repose, a
slight breeze passed over the calmness of my mirror. I had
given, perhaps imprudently, but certainly with generous motives,
a double pay to my men in recompense of their perilous service
on the Rio Nunez. With the usual recklessness of their craft,
they lounged about Havana, boasting of their success, while a
Frenchman of the party,&mdash;who had been swindled of his wages
at cards,&mdash;appealed to his Consul for relief. By dint of cross
questions the Gallic official extracted the tale of our voyage from
his countryman, and took advantage of the fellow&rsquo;s destitution to
make him a witness against a certain Don T&eacute;odore Canot, who
<i>was alleged to be a native of France</i>! Besides this, the punishment
of my mate was exaggerated by the recreant Frenchman
into a most unjustifiable as well as cruel act.</p>

<p>Of course the story was promptly detailed to the Captain-General,
who issued an order for my arrest. But I was too wary
and flush to be caught so easily by the guardian of France&rsquo;s lilies.
No person bearing my name could be found in the island;
and as the schooner had entered port with Spanish papers, Spanish
crew, and was regularly sold, it became manifest to the stupefied
Consul that the sailor&rsquo;s &ldquo;yarn&rdquo; was an entire fabrication.
That night a convenient press-gang, in want of recruits for the
royal marine, seized the braggadocio crew, and as there were no
witnesses to corroborate the Consul&rsquo;s complaint, it was forthwith
dismissed.</p>

<p>Things are managed very cleverly in Havana&mdash;<i>when you
know how</i>!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg&nbsp;248]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>


<p>Before I went to sea again, I took a long holiday with full
pockets, among my old friends at Regla and Havana. I thought
it possible that a residence in Cuba for a season, aloof from
traders and their transactions, might wean me from Africa; but
three months had hardly elapsed, before I found myself sailing
out of the harbor of St. Jago de Cuba to take, in Jamaica, a cargo
of merchandise for the coast, and then to return and refit for
slaves in Cuba.</p>

<p>My voyage began with a gale, which for three days swept us
along on a tolerably good course, but on the night of the third,
after snapping my mainmast on a lee shore, I was forced to
beach the schooner in order to save our lives and cargo from destruction.
Fortunately, we effected our landing with complete
success, and at dawn I found my gallant little craft a total wreck
on an uninhabited key. A large tent or pavilion was quickly
built from our sails, sweeps, and remaining spars, beneath which
every thing valuable and undamaged was stored before nightfall.
Parties were sent forth to reconnoitre, while our remaining
foremast was unshipped, and planted on the highest part of the
sandbank with a signal of distress. The scouts returned without
consolation. Nothing had been seen except a large dog, whose
neck was encircled with a collar; but as he could not be made to
approach by kindness, I forbade his execution. Neither smoke
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg&nbsp;249]</a></span>
nor tobacco freed us of the cloudy swarms of mosquitoes that filled
the air after sunset, and so violent was the irritation of their
innumerable stings, that a delicate boy among the crew became
utterly insane, and was not restored till long after his return to
Cuba.</p>

<p>Several sad and weary days passed over us on this desolate
key, where our mode of life brought to my recollection many a
similar hour spent by me in company with Don Rafael and his
companions. Vessel after vessel passed the reef, but none took
notice of our signal. At last, on the tenth day of our imprisonment,
a couple of small schooners fanned their way in a nonchalant
manner towards our island, and knowing that we were quite
at their mercy, refused our rescue unless we assented to the
most extravagant terms of compensation. After a good deal of
chaffering, it was agreed that the salvors should land us and our
effects at Nassau, New Providence, where the average should be
determined by the lawful tribunal. The voyage was soon accomplished,
and our amiable liberators from the mosquitoes of our
island prison obtained a judicial award of seventy per cent. for
their extraordinary trouble!</p>

<p>The wreck and the wreckers made so formidable an inroad
upon my finances, that I was very happy when I reached Cuba
once more, to accept the berth of sailing-master in a slave brig
which was fitting out at St. Thomas&rsquo;s, under an experienced
Frenchman.</p>

<p>My new craft, the <span class="smcap">San Pablo</span>, was a trim Brazil-built brig,
of rather more than 300 tons. Her hold contained sixteen
twenty-four carronades, while her magazine was stocked with
abundance of ammunition, and her kelson lined, fore and aft,
with round shot and grape. Captain * * *, who had been described
as a Tartar and martinet, received me with much affability,
and seemed charmed when I told him that I conversed fluently
not only in French but in English.</p>

<p>I had hardly arrived and begun to take the dimensions of my
new equipage, when a report ran through the harbor that a Danish
cruiser was about to touch at the island. Of course, every
thing was instantly afloat, and in a bustle to be off. Stores and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg&nbsp;250]</a></span>
provisions were tumbled in pell-mell, tanks were filled with water
during the night; and, before dawn, fifty-five ragamuffins of
all castes, colors, and countries, were shipped as crew. By &ldquo;six
bells,&rdquo; with a coasting flag at our peak, we were two miles at sea
with our main-topsail aback, receiving six kegs of specie and several
chests of clothing from a lugger.</p>

<p>When we were fairly on &ldquo;blue water&rdquo; I discovered that our
voyage, though a slaver&rsquo;s, was not of an ordinary character. On
the second day, the mariners were provided with two setts of
uniform, to be worn on Sundays or when called to quarters.
Gold-laced caps, blue coats with anchor buttons, single epaulettes,
and side arms were distributed to the officers, while a brief
address from the captain on the quarter-deck, apprised all hands
that if the enterprise resulted well, <i>a bounty</i> of one hundred dollars
would be paid to each adventurer.</p>

<p>That night our skipper took me into council and developed
his plan, which was to load in a port in the Mozambique channel.
To effect his purpose with more security, he had provided
the brig with an armament sufficient to repel a man-of-war of
equal size&mdash;(a fancy I never gave way to)&mdash;and on all occasions,
except in presence of a French cruiser, he intended to hoist the
Bourbon lilies, wear the Bourbon uniform, and conduct the vessel
in every way as if she belonged to the royal navy. Nor
were the officers to be less favored than the sailors in regard to
double salary, certificates of which were handed to me for myself
and my two subordinates. A memorandum book was then
supplied, containing minute instructions for each day of the ensuing
week, and I was specially charged, as second in command,
to be cautiously punctual in all my duties, and severely just towards
my inferiors.</p>

<p>I took some pride in acquitting myself creditably in this new
military phase of a slaver&rsquo;s life. Very few days sufficed to put
the rigging and sails in perfect condition; to mount my sixteen
guns; to drill the men with small arms as well as artillery; and
by paint and sea-craft, to disguise the Saint Paul as a very respectable
cruiser.</p>

<p>In twenty-seven days we touched at the Cape de Verds for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg&nbsp;251]</a></span>
provisions, and shaped our way southward without speaking a
single vessel of the multitude we met, until off the Cape of Good
Hope we encountered a stranger who was evidently bent upon
being sociable. Nevertheless, our inhospitable spirit forced us to
hold our course unswervingly, till from peak and main we saw
the white flag and pennant of France unfurled to the wind.</p>

<p>Our drum immediately beat to quarters, while the flag chest
was brought on deck. Presently, the French <i>transport</i> demanded
our private signal; which out of our ample supply, was
promptly answered, and the royal ensign of Portugal set at our
peak.</p>

<p>As we approached the Frenchman every thing was made ready
for all hazards;&mdash;our guns were double-shotted, our matches
lighted, our small arms distributed. The moment we came within
hail, our captain,&mdash;who claimed precedence of the lieutenant of
a transport,&mdash;spoke the Frenchman; and, for a while, carried on
quite an amiable chat in Portuguese. At last the stranger requested
leave to send his boat aboard with letters for the Isle
of France; to which we consented with the greatest pleasure,
though our captain thought it fair to inform him that we dared
not prudently invite his officers on deck, inasmuch as there were
&ldquo;several cases of small-pox among our crew, contracted, in all
likelihood, at Angola!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The discharge of an unexpected broadside could not have
struck our visitor with more dismay or horror. The words were
hardly spoken when her decks were in a bustle,&mdash;her yards braced
sharply to the wind,&mdash;and her prow boiling through the sea,
without so much as the compliment of a &ldquo;<i>bon voyage</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ten days after this <i>ruse d&rsquo;esclave</i> we anchored at Quillimane,
among a lot of Portuguese and Brazilian slavers, whose sails were
either clewed up or unbent as if for a long delay. We fired a
salute of twenty guns and ran up the French flag. The salvo was
quickly answered, while our captain, in the full uniform of a
naval commander, paid his respects to the Governor. Meantime
orders were given me to remain carefully in charge of the ship;
to avoid all intercourse with others; to go through the complete
routine and show of a man-of-war; to strike the yards, haul down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg&nbsp;252]</a></span>
signal, and fire a gun at sunset; but especially to get underway
and meet the captain at a small beach off the port, the instant I
saw a certain flag flying from the fort.</p>

<p>I have rarely seen matters conducted more skilfully than they
were by this daring Gaul. Next morning early the Governor&rsquo;s
boat was sent for the specie; the fourth day disclosed the signal
that called us to the beach; the fifth, sixth, and seventh, supplied
us with <i>eight hundred negroes</i>; and, on the ninth, we were
underway for our destination.</p>

<p>The success of this enterprise was more remarkable because
fourteen vessels, waiting cargoes, were at anchor when we arrived,
some of which had been detained in port over fifteen months. To
such a pitch had their impatience risen, that the masters made
common cause against all new-comers, and agreed that each vessel
should take its turn for supply according to date of arrival.
But the astuteness of my veteran circumvented all these plans.
His anchorage and non-intercourse as <i>a French man-of-war</i> lulled
every suspicion or intrigue against him, and he adroitly took
advantage of his kegs of specie to win the heart of the authorities
and factors who supplied the slaves.</p>

<p>But wit and cleverness are not all in this world. Our
captain returned in high spirits to his vessel; but we hardly
reached the open sea before he was prostrated with an ague which
refused to yield to ordinary remedies, and finally ripened into
fever, that deprived him of reason. Other dangers thickened
around us. We had been several days off the Cape of Good
Hope, buffeting a series of adverse gales, when word was brought
me after a night of weary watching, that several slaves were ill
of small-pox. Of all calamities that occur in the voyage of a
slaver, this is the most dreaded and unmanageable. The news appalled
me. Impetuous with anxiety I rushed to the captain, and
regardless of fever or insanity, disclosed the dreadful fact. He
stared at me for a minute as if in doubt; then opening his bureau
and pointing to a long coil of combustible material, said that it
communicated through the decks with the powder magazine, and
ordered me to&mdash;&ldquo;<i>blow up the brig!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The master&rsquo;s madness sobered his mate. I lost no time in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg&nbsp;253]</a></span>
securing both the dangerous implement and its perilous owner,
while I called the officers into the cabin for inquiry and consultation
as to our desperate state.</p>

<p>The gale had lasted nine days without intermission, and during
all this time with so much violence that it was impossible to
take off the gratings, release the slaves, purify the decks, or rig
the wind-sails. When the first lull occurred, a thorough inspection
of the eight hundred was made, and <i>a death announced</i>. As
life had departed during the tempest, a careful inspection of the
body was made, and it was this that first disclosed the pestilence
in our midst. The corpse was silently thrown into the sea, and
the malady kept secret from crew and negroes.</p>

<p>When breakfast was over on that fatal morning, I determined
to visit the slave deck myself, and ordering an abundant supply
of lanterns, descended to the cavern, which still reeked horribly
with human vapor, even after ventilation. But here, alas!
I found nine of the negroes infected by the disease. We took
counsel as to the use of laudanum in ridding ourselves speedily
of the sufferers,&mdash;a remedy that is seldom and secretly used in
<i>desperate</i> cases to preserve the living from contagion. But it was
quickly resolved that it had already gone too far, when nine were
prostrated, to save the rest by depriving them of life. Accordingly,
these wretched beings were at once sent to the forecastle
as a hospital, and given in charge to the vaccinated or innoculated
as nurses. The hold was then ventilated and limed; yet
before the gale abated, our sick list was increased to thirty.
The hospital could hold no more. Twelve of the sailors took the
infection, and fifteen corpses had been cast in the sea!</p>

<p>All reserve was now at an end. Body after body fed the
deep, and still the gale held on. At last, when the wind and
waves had lulled so much as to allow the gratings to be removed
from our hatches, our consternation knew no bounds when we
found that nearly all the slaves were dead or dying with the distemper.
I will not dwell on the scene or our sensations. It is
a picture that must gape with all its horrors before the least
vivid imagination. Yet there was no time for languor or sentimental
sorrow. Twelve of the stoutest survivors were ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg&nbsp;254]</a></span>
to drag out the dead from among the ill, and though they were
constantly drenched with rum to brutalize them, still we were
forced to aid the gang by reckless volunteers from our crew,
who, arming their hands with tarred mittens, flung the f&oelig;tid
masses of putrefaction into the sea!</p>

<p>One day was a counterpart of another; and yet the love of
life, or, perhaps, the love of gold, made us fight the monster with
a courage that became a better cause. At length death was
satisfied, but not until the eight hundred beings we had shipped
in high health had dwindled to four hundred and ninety-seven
skeletons!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>


<p>The San Pablo might have been considered entitled to a &ldquo;clean
bill of health&rdquo; by the time she reached the equator. The dead
left space, food, and water for the living, and very little restraint
was imposed on the squalid remnant. None were shackled
after the outbreak of the fatal plague, so that in a short
time the survivors began to fatten for the market to which they
were hastening. But such was not the fate of our captain. The
fever and delirium had long left him, yet a dysenteric tendency,&mdash;the
result of a former malady,&mdash;suddenly supervened, and the
worthy gentleman rapidly declined. His nerves gave way so thoroughly,
that from fanciful weakness he lapsed into helpless hypochondria.
One of his pet ideas was that a copious dose of calomel
would ensure his restoration to perfect health. Unfortunately,
however, during the prevalence of the plague, our medicine
chest had one day been accidentally left exposed, and our mercury
was abstracted. Still there was no use to attempt calming
him with the assurance that his <i>nostrum</i> could not be had. The
more we argued the impossibility of supplying him, the more was
he urgent and imperative for the sanative mineral.</p>

<p>In this dilemma I ordered a bright look-out to be kept for
merchantmen from whom I hoped to obtain the desirable drug.
At last a sail was reported two points under our lee, and as her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg&nbsp;256]</a></span>
canvas was both patched and dark, I considered her a harmless
Briton who might be approached with impunity.</p>

<p>It proved to be a brig from Belfast, in Ireland; but when I
overhauled the skipper and desired him to send a boat on board,
he declined the invitation and kept his course. A second and
third command shared the same fate. I was somewhat nettled
by this disregard of my flag, pennant, and starboard epaulette,
and ordering the brig to be run alongside, I made her fast to the
recusant, and boarded with ten men.</p>

<p>Our reception was, of course, not very amicable, though no
show of resistance was made by officers or crew. I informed
the captain that my object in stopping him was entirely one of
mercy, and repeated the request I had previously made through
the speaking trumpet. Still, the stubborn Scotchman persisted
in denying the medicine, though I offered him payment in silver
or gold. Thereupon, I commanded the mate to produce his log-book,
and, under my dictation, to note the visit of the San Pablo,
my request, and its churlish denial. This being done to my satisfaction,
I ordered two of my hands to search for the medicine
chest, which turned out to be a sorry receptacle of stale drugs,
though fortunately containing an abundance of calomel. I did
not parley about appropriating a third of the mineral, for which
I counted five silver dollars on the cabin table. But the metal
was no sooner exhibited than my Scotchman refused it with disdain.
I handed it, however, to the mate, and exacted a receipt,
which was noted in the log-book.</p>

<p>As I put my leg over the taffrail, I tried once more to smooth
the bristles of the terrier, but a snarl and a snap repaid me for
my good humor. Nevertheless, I resolved &ldquo;to heap coals of
fire on the head&rdquo; of the ingrate; and, before I cast off our lashings,
threw on his deck a dozen yams, a bag of frijoles, a barrel
of pork, a couple of sacks of white Spanish biscuits,&mdash;and, with
a cheer, bade him adieu.</p>

<p>But there was no balm in calomel for the captain. Scotch
physic could not save him. He declined day by day; yet the
energy of his hard nature kept him alive when other men would
have sunk, and enabled him to command even from his sick bed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg&nbsp;257]</a></span>
It was always our Sabbath service to drum the men to quarters
and exercise them with cannons and small arms. One Sunday,
after the routine was over, the dying man desired to inspect
his crew, and was carried to the quarter-deck on a mattress.
Each sailor marched in front of him and was allowed to take his
hand; after which he called them around in a body, and announced
his apprehension that death would claim him before our
destination was reached. Then, without previously apprising us
of his design, he proceeded to make a verbal testament, and enjoined
it upon all as a duty to his memory to obey implicitly.
If the San Pablo arrived safely in port, he desired that every
officer and mariner should be paid the promised bounty, and that
the proceeds of cargo should be sent to his family in Nantz.
But, if it happened that we were attacked by a cruiser, and the
brig was saved by the risk and valor of a defence,&mdash;then, he
directed that one half the voyage&rsquo;s avails should be shared
between officers and crew, while one quarter was sent to his
friends in France, and the other given to me. His sailing-master
and Cuban consignees were to be the executors of this salt water
document.</p>

<p>We were now well advanced north-westwardly on our voyage,
and in every cloud could see a promise of the continuing trade-wind,
which was shortly to end a luckless voyage. From deck
to royal,&mdash;from flying-jib to ring-tail, every stitch of canvas that
would draw was packed and crowded on the brig. Vessels were
daily seen in numbers, but none appeared suspicious till we got
far to the westward, when my glass detected a cruising schooner,
jogging along under easy sail. I ordered the helmsman to keep
his course; and taughtening sheets, braces, and halyards, went
into the cabin to receive the final orders of our commander.</p>

<p>He received my story with his usual bravery, nor was he
startled when a boom from the cruiser&rsquo;s gun announced her in
chase. He pointed to one of his drawers and told me to take
out its contents. I handed him three flags, which he carefully
unrolled, and displayed the ensigns of Spain, Denmark, and
Portugal, in each of which I found a set of papers suitable for
the San Pablo. In a feeble voice he desired me to select a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg&nbsp;258]</a></span>
nationality; and, when I chose the Spanish, he grasped my hand,
pointed to the door, and bade me not to surrender.</p>

<p>When I reached the deck, I found our pursuer gaining on
us with the utmost speed. She outsailed us&mdash;two to one.
Escape was altogether out of the question; yet I resolved to
show the inquisitive stranger our mettle, by keeping my course,
firing a gun, and hoisting my Spanish signals at peak and main.</p>

<p>At this time the San Pablo was spinning along finely at the
rate of about six knots an hour, when a shot from the schooner
fell close to our stern. In a moment I ordered in studding-sails
alow and aloft, and as my men had been trained to their duty in
man-of-war fashion, I hoped to impose on the cruiser by the style
and perfection of the man&oelig;uvre. Still, however, she kept her
way, and, in four hours after discovery, was within half gun-shot
of the brig.</p>

<p>Hitherto I had not touched my armament, but I selected this
moment to load under the enemy&rsquo;s eyes, and, at the word of command,
to fling open the ports and run out my barkers. The act
was performed to a charm by my well-drilled gunners; yet all
our belligerent display had not the least effect on the schooner,
which still pursued us. At last, within hail, her commander
leaped on a gun, and ordered me to &ldquo;heave to, or take a ball!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, I was prepared for this arrogant command, and, for
half an hour, had made up my mind how to avoid an engagement.
A single discharge of my broadside might have sunk or seriously
damaged our antagonist, but the consequences would have been
terrible if he boarded me, which I believed to be his aim.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I paid no attention to the threat, but taughtened
my ropes and surged ahead. Presently, my racing chaser came
up <i>under my lee</i> within pistol-shot, when a reiterated command
to heave to or be fired on, was answered for the first time by a
faint &ldquo;<i>no intiendo</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo;&mdash;while the
man-of-war shot ahead of me.</p>

<p><i>Then I had him!</i> Quick as thought, I gave the order to
&ldquo;square away,&rdquo; and putting the helm up, struck the cruiser
near the bow, carrying away her foremast and bowsprit. Such
was the stranger&rsquo;s surprise at my daring trick that not a musket
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg&nbsp;259]</a></span>
was fired or boarder stirred, till we were clear of the wreck. It
was then too late. The loss of my jib-boom and a few rope-yarns
did not prevent me from cracking on my studding-sails, and
leaving the lubber to digest his stupid <i>forbearance</i>!</p>

<p>This adventure was a fitting epitaph for the stormy life of our
poor commander, who died on the following night, and was buried
under a choice selection of the flags he had honored with his
various nationalities. A few days after the blue water had closed
over him for ever, our cargo was safely ensconced in the <i>hacienda</i>
nine miles east of St. Jago de Cuba, while the San Pablo was
sent adrift and burnt to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg&nbsp;260]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>


<p>The beneficent disposition of my late commander, though not a
regular testament, was carried out in Cuba, and put me in possession
of twelve thousand dollars as my share of the enterprise.
Yet my restless spirit did not allow me to remain idle. Our
successful voyage had secured me scores of friends among the
Spanish slavers, and I received daily applications for a fresh
command.</p>

<p>But the plans of my French friend had so bewitched me with
a desire for imitation, that I declined subordinate posts and
aspired to ownership. Accordingly, I proposed to the proprietor
of a large American clipper-brig, that we should fit her on the
same system as the San Pablo; yet, wishing to surpass my late
captain in commercial success, I suggested the idea of fighting
for our cargo, or, in plainer language, of relieving another slaver
of her living freight, a project which promptly found favor with
the owner of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">La Conchita</span>.&rdquo; The vessel in question originally
cost twelve thousand dollars, and I proposed to cover this
value by expending an equal sum on her outfit, in order to constitute
me half owner.</p>

<p>The bargain was struck, and the armament, sails, additional
spars, rigging, and provisions went on board, with prudential
secrecy. Inasmuch as we could not leave port without some
show of a cargo, merchandise <i>in bond</i> was taken from the public
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg&nbsp;261]</a></span>
warehouses, and, after being loaded in our hold during day, was
smuggled ashore again at night. As the man&oelig;uvre was a trick
of my accomplice, who privately gained by the operation, I took
no notice of what was delivered or taken away.</p>

<p>Finally, all was ready. Forty-five men were shipped, and
the Conchita cleared. Next day, at daybreak, I was to sail with
the land-breeze.</p>

<p>A sailor&rsquo;s last night ashore is proverbial, and none of the
customary ceremonies were omitted on this occasion. There was
a parting supper with plenty of champagne; there was a visit to
the <i>caf&eacute;</i>; a farewell call here, another there, and a bumper every
where. In fact, till two in the morning, I was busy with my
adieus; but when I got home at last, with a thumping headache,
I was met at the door by a note from my partner, stating that
our vessel was seized, and an order issued for my arrest. He
counselled me to keep aloof from the <i>alguaziles</i>, till he could
arrange the matter with the custom-house and police.</p>

<p>I will not enlarge this chapter of disasters. Next day, my
accomplice was lodged in prison for his fraud, the vessel confiscated,
her outfit sold, and my purse cropped to the extent of
twelve thousand dollars. I had barely time to escape before the
officers were in my lodgings; and I finally saved myself from an
acquaintance with the interior of a Cuban prison, by taking
another name, and playing <i>ranchero</i> among the hills for several
weeks.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>My finances were at low-water mark, when I strolled one fine
morning into Matanzas, and, after some delay, again obtained
command of a slaver, through the secret influence of my old and
trusty friends. The new craft was a dashing schooner, of one
hundred and twenty tons, fresh from the United States, and
intended for Ayudah on the Gold Coast. It was calculated that
we might bring home at least four hundred and fifty slaves, for
whose purchase, I was supplied plentifully with rum, powder,
English muskets, and rich cottons from Manchester.</p>

<p>In due time we sailed for the Cape de Verds, the usual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg&nbsp;262]</a></span>
&ldquo;port of despatch&rdquo; on such excursions; and at Praya, exchanged
our flag for the Portuguese, before we put up our helm
for the coast. A British cruiser chased us fruitlessly for two
days off Sierra Leone, and enabled me not only to test the sailing
qualities, but to get the <i>sailing trim</i> of the &ldquo;Estrella,&rdquo; in
perfection. So confident did I become of the speed and bottom
of my gallant clipper, that I ventured, with a leading wind, to
chase the first vessel I descried on the horizon, and was altogether
deceived by the tri-color displayed at her peak. Indeed,
I could not divine this novel nationality, till the speaking trumpet
apprised us that the lilies of France had taken triple hues
in the hands of Louis Philippe! Accordingly, before I squared
away for Ayudah, I saluted the <i>royal republican</i>, by lowering
my flag thrice to the new divinity.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I consigned the Estrella to one of the most remarkable
traders that ever expanded the African traffic by his genius.</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Da Souza,&mdash;better known on the coast and interior
as Cha-cha,&mdash;was said to be a native mulatto of Rio Janeiro,
whence he emigrated to Dahomey, after deserting the arms of his
imperial master. I do not know how he reached Africa, but it is
probable the fugitive made part of some slaver&rsquo;s crew, and fled
from his vessel, as he had previously abandoned the military service
in the delicious clime of Brazil. His parents were poor,
indolent, and careless, so that Cha-cha grew up an illiterate,
headstrong youth. Yet, when he touched the soil of Africa, a
new life seemed infused into his veins. For a while, his days
are said to have been full of misery and trouble, but the Brazilian
slave-trade happened to receive an extraordinary impetus
about that period; and, gradually, the adventurous refugee managed
to profit by his skill in dealing with the natives, or by acting
as broker among his countrymen. Beginning in the humblest
way, he stuck to trade with the utmost tenacity till he ripened into
an opulent factor. The tinge of native blood that dyed his complexion,
perhaps qualified him peculiarly for this enterprise. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg&nbsp;263]</a></span>
loved the customs of the people. He spoke their language with
the fluency of a native. He won the favor of chief after chief.
He strove to be considered a perfect African among Africans;
though, among whites, he still affected the graceful address and
manners of his country. In this way, little by little, Cha-cha
advanced in the regard of all he dealt with, and secured the commissions
of Brazil and Cuba, while he was regarded and protected
as a prime favorite by the warlike king of Dahomey.
Indeed, it is alleged that this noted sovereign formed a sort of
devilish compact with the Portuguese factor, and supplied him
with every thing he desired during life, in consideration of inheriting
his wealth when dead.</p>

<p>But Cha-cha was resolved, while the power of enjoyment was
still vouchsafed him, that all the pleasures of human life, accessible
to money, should not be wanting in Ayudah. He built a
large and commodious dwelling for his residence on a beautiful
spot, near the site of an abandoned Portuguese fort. He filled
his establishment with every luxury and comfort that could please
the fancy, or gratify the body. Wines, food, delicacies and raiment,
were brought from Paris, London, and Havana. The
finest women along the coast were lured to his settlement. Billiard
tables and gambling halls spread their wiles, or afforded distraction
for detained navigators. In fine, the mongrel Sybarite
surrounded himself with all that could corrupt virtue, gratify
passion, tempt avarice, betray weakness, satisfy sensuality, and
complete a picture of incarnate slavery in Dahomey.</p>

<p>When he sallied forth, his walk was always accompanied by
considerable ceremony. An officer preceded him to clear the
path; a fool or buffoon hopped beside him; a band of native
musicians sounded their discordant instruments, and a couple of
singers screamed, at the top of their voices, the most fulsome
adulation of the mulatto.</p>

<p>Numbers of vessels were, of course, required to feed this
African nabob with doubloons and merchandise. Sometimes,
commanders from Cuba or Brazil would be kept months in his
perilous nest, while their craft cruised along the coast, in expectation
of human cargoes. At such seasons, no expedient was left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg&nbsp;264]</a></span>
untried for the entertainment and pillage of wealthy or trusted
idlers. If Cha-cha&rsquo;s board and wines made them drunkards, it
was no fault of his. If <i>rouge et noir</i>, or <i>monte</i>, won their
doubloons and freight at his saloon, he regretted, but dared not
interfere with the amusements of his guests. If the sirens of
his harem betrayed a cargo for their favor over cards, a convenient
fire destroyed the frail warehouse after its merchandise was
secretly removed!</p>

<p>Cha-cha was exceedingly desirous that I should accept his
hospitality. As soon as I read my invoice to him,&mdash;for he could
not do it himself,&mdash;he became almost irresistible in his <i>empressement</i>.
Yet I declined the invitation with firm politeness, and
took up my quarters on shore, at the residence of a native <i>manfuca</i>,
or broker. I was warned of his allurements before I left
Matanzas, and resolved to keep myself and property so clear of
his clutches, that our contract would either be fulfilled or remain
within my control. Thus, by avoiding his table, his &ldquo;hells,&rdquo; and
the society of his dissipated sons, I maintained my business relations
with the slaver, and secured his personal respect so effectually,
that, at the end of two months, four hundred and eighty
prime negroes were in the bowels of La Estrella.<a name="FNanchor_5_10" id="FNanchor_5_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_10" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL.</h2>


<p>If I had dreamed that these recollections of my African career
would ever be made public, it is probable I should have taxed
my memory with many events and characteristic anecdotes, of
interest to those who study the progress of mankind, and the
singular manifestations of human intellect in various portions of
Ethiopia.</p>

<p>During my travels on that continent, I always found the negro
a believer in some superior creative and controlling power, except
among the marshes at the mouth of the Rio Pongo, where the
Bagers, as I already stated, imagine that death is total annihilation.
The Mandingoes and Fullahs have their Islamism and its
Koran; the Soosoo has his good spirits and bad; another nation
has its &ldquo;pray-men&rdquo; and &ldquo;book-men,&rdquo; with their special creeds;
another relies on the omnipotence of <i>juju</i> priests and <i>fetiche</i> worship;<a name="FNanchor_6_11" id="FNanchor_6_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_11" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
some believe in the immortality of spirit; while others
confide in the absolute translation of body. The Mahometan
tribes adore the Creator, with an infinitude of ablutions, genuflexions,
prayers, fasts, and by strictly adhering to the laws of the
Prophet; while the heathen nations resort to their adroit priests,
who shield them from the devil by charms of various degree,
which are exclusively in their gift, and may consequently be imposed
on the credulous for enormous prices.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg&nbsp;266]</a></span>
At Ayudah I found the natives addicted to a very grovelling
species of idolatry. It was their belief that the Good as well as the
Evil spirit existed in living Iguanas. In the home of the <i>manfuca</i>,
with whom I dwelt, several of these animals were constantly
fed and cherished as <i>dii penates</i>, nor was any one allowed
to interfere with their freedom, or to harm them when they grew
insufferably offensive. The death of one of these crawling deities
is considered a calamity in the household, and grief for the reptile
becomes as great as for a departed parent.</p>

<p>Whilst I tarried at Ayudah, an invitation came from the
King of Dahomey, soliciting the presence of Cha-cha and his
guests at the yearly sacrifice of human beings, whose blood is
shed not only to appease an irritated god but to satiate the appetite
of departed kings. I regret that I did not accompany the
party that was present at this dreadful festival. Cha-cha despatched
several of the captains who were waiting cargoes, under
the charge of his own interpreters and the royal <i>manfucas</i>; and
from one of these eye-witnesses, whose curiosity was painfully
satiated, I received a faithful account of the horrid spectacle.</p>

<p>For three days our travellers passed through a populous region,
fed with abundant repasts prepared in the native villages
by Cha-cha&rsquo;s cooks, and resting at night in hammocks suspended
among the trees. On the fourth day the party reached the great
capital of Abomey, to which the king had come for the bloody
festival from his residence at Cannah. My friends were comfortably
lodged for repose, and next morning presented to the sovereign.
He was a well-built negro, dressed in the petticoat-trowsers
of a Turk, with yellow morocco boots, while a profusion
of silk shawls encircled his shoulders and waist, and a lofty <i>chapeau</i>,
with trailing plumes, surmounted his wool. A vast body-guard
of <i>female</i> soldiers or amazons, armed with lances and muskets,
surrounded his majesty. Presently, the <i>manfucas</i> and interpreters,
crawling abjectly on their hands and knees to the
royal feet, deposited Cha-cha&rsquo;s tribute and the white men&rsquo;s offering.
The first consisted of several pieces of crape, silks, and taffeta,
with a large pitcher and basin of silver; while the latter
was a trifling gift of twenty muskets and one hundred pieces of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg&nbsp;267]</a></span>
blue <i>dungeree</i>. The present was gracefully accepted, and the donors
welcomed to the sacrifice, which was delayed on account of
the scarcity of victims, though orders had been given to storm a
neighboring tribe to make up three hundred slaves for the festival.
In the mean while, a spacious house, furnished in European
style, and altogether better than the ordinary dwellings of
Africa, was assigned to the strangers. Liberty was also given
them to enter wherever they pleased, and take what they wished,
inasmuch as all his subjects, male and female, were slaves whom
he placed at the white men&rsquo;s disposal.</p>

<p>The sixth of May was announced as the beginning of the sacrificial
rites, which were to last five days. Early in the morning,
two hundred females of the amazonian guard, naked to the
waist, but richly ornamented with beads and rings at every
joint of their oiled and glistening limbs, appeared in the area
before the king&rsquo;s palace, armed with blunt cutlasses. Very
soon the sovereign made his appearance, when the band of warriors
began their man&oelig;uvres, keeping pace, with rude but not unmartial
skill, to the native drum and flute.</p>

<p>A short distance from the palace, within sight of the square,
a fort or inclosure, about nine feet high, had been built of <i>adobe</i>,
and surrounded by a pile of tall, prickly briers. Within this
barrier, secured to stakes, stood fifty captives who were to be
immolated at the opening of the festival. When the drill of the
amazons and the royal review were over, there was, for a considerable
time, perfect silence in the ranks and throughout the vast
multitude of spectators. Presently, at a signal from the king,
one hundred of the women departed at a run, brandishing their
weapons and yelling their war-cry, till, heedless of the thorny
barricade, they leaped the walls, lacerating their flesh in crossing
the prickly impediment. The delay was short. Fifty of these
female demons, with torn limbs and bleeding faces, quickly returned,
and offered their howling victims to the king. It was now
the duty of this personage to begin the sacrifice with his royal
hand. Calling the female whose impetuous daring had led her
foremost across the thorns, he took a glittering sword from her
grasp, and in an instant the head of the first victim fell to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg&nbsp;268]</a></span>
dust. The weapon was then returned to the woman, who, handing
it to the white men, desired them to unite in the brutal deed!
The strangers, however, not only refused, but, sick at heart,
abandoned the scene of butchery, which lasted, they understood,
till noon, when the amazons were dismissed to their barracks,
reeking with rum and blood.</p>

<p>I have limited the details of this barbarity to the initial cruelties,
leaving the reader&rsquo;s imagination to fancy the atrocities
that followed the second blow. It has always been noticed that
the sight of blood, which appals a civilized man, serves to excite
and enrage the savage, till his frantic passions induce him to
mutilate his victims, even as a tiger becomes furious after it has
torn the first wound in its prey. For five days the strangers
were doomed to hear the yells of the storming amazons as they
assailed the fort for fresh victims. On the sixth the sacrifice was
over:&mdash;the divinity was appeased, and quiet reigned again in the
streets of Abomey.</p>

<p>Our travellers were naturally anxious to quit a court where
such abominations were regarded as national and religious duties;
but before they departed, his majesty proposed to accord
them a parting interview. He received the strangers with ceremonious
politeness, and called their attention to the throne or
royal seat upon which he had coiled his limbs. The chair is said
to have been an heir-loom of at least twenty generations. Each
leg of the article rests on the skull of some native king or chief,
and such is the fanatical respect for the brutal usages of antiquity,
that every three years the people of Dahomey are
obliged to renew the steadiness of the stool by the fresh skulls
of some noted princes!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I was not long enough at Ayudah to observe the manners and
customs of the natives with much care, still, as well as I now remember,
there was great similarity to the habits of other tribes.
The male lords it over the weaker sex, and as a man is valued
according to the quantity of his wives; polygamy, even among
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg&nbsp;269]</a></span>
civilized residents, is carried to a greater excess than elsewhere.
Female chastity is not insisted on as in the Mandingo and Soosoo
districts, but the husband contents himself with the seeming continence
of his mistresses. Sixty or seventy miles south of Ayudah,
the adulterous wife of a chief is stabbed in the presence of
her relations. Here, also, superstition has set up the altar of
human sacrifice, but the divinity considers the offering of a single
virgin sufficient for all its requirements.</p>

<p>Some years after my visit to Ayudah, it happened that my
traffic called me to Lagos at the season of this annual festival, so
that I became an unwilling witness of the horrid scene.</p>

<p>When the slender crescent of the November moon is first observed,
an edict goes forth from the king that his <i>Juju-man</i>, or
high-priest, will go his annual round through the town, and during
his progress it is strictly forbidden for any of his subjects to
remain out of doors after sunset. Such is the terror with which
the priests affect to regard the sacred demon, that even the fires
are extinguished in their houses.</p>

<p>Towards midnight the <i>Juju-man</i> issued from a sacred <i>gree-gree</i>
bush or grove, the entrance to which is inhibited to all negroes
who do not belong to the religious brotherhood. The costume
of the impostor is calculated to inspire his countrymen with fear.
He was clad in a garment that descended from his waist to his
heels like a petticoat or skirt, made of long black fur; a cape of
the same material was clasped round his neck and covered his
elbows; a gigantic hood which bristled with all the ferocity of a
grenadier&rsquo;s cap, covered his head; his hands were disguised in
tiger&rsquo;s paws, while a frightful mask, with sharp nose, thin lips,
and white color, concealed his face. He was accompanied by ten
stout barbarians, dressed and masked like himself, each sounding
some discordant instrument. Every door, by law, is required to
be left ajar for the free access of the <i>Juju</i>, but as soon as the
horrid noise is heard approaching from the <i>tabooed grove</i>, each
inhabitant falls to the ground, with eyes in the dust, to avoid even
a look from the irritated spirit.</p>

<p>A victim is always agreed upon by the priests and the authorities
before they leave the <i>gree-gree bush</i>, yet to instil a greater
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg&nbsp;270]</a></span>
degree of superstitious terror, the frightful <i>Juju</i>, as if in doubt,
promenades the town till daylight, entering a house now and
then, and sometimes committing a murder or two to augment the
panic. At dawn the home of the victim,&mdash;who, of course, is always
the handsomest virgin in the settlement,&mdash;is reached, and
the <i>Juju</i> immediately seizes and carries her to a place of concealment.
Under pain of death her parents and friends are denied
the privilege of uttering a complaint, or even of lifting their
heads from the dust. Next day the unfortunate mother must
seem ignorant of her daughter&rsquo;s doom, or profess herself proud
of the <i>Juju&rsquo;s</i> choice. Two days pass without notice of the victim.
On the third, at the river side, the king meets his fanatical
subjects, clad in their choicest raiment, and wearing their sweetest
smiles. A hand of music salutes the sovereign, and suddenly
the poor victim, <i>no longer a virgin and perfectly denuded</i>, is
brought forward by a wizard, who is to act the part of executioner.
The living sacrifice moves slowly with measured steps, but
is no more to be recognized even by her nearest relatives, for
face, body, and limbs, are covered thickly with chalk. As soon
as she halts before the king, her hands and feet are bound to a
bench near the trunk of a tree. The executioner then takes his
stand, and with uplifted eyes and arms, seems to invoke a blessing
on the people, while with a single blow of his blade, her head
is rolled into the river. The bleeding trunk, laid carefully on a
mat, is placed beneath a large tree to remain till a spirit shall
bear it to the land of rest, and at night it is secretly removed by
the priesthood.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to know that these <i>Jujus</i>, who in Africa assume
the prerogatives of divinity, are only the principals of a
religious fraternity who from time immemorial have constituted a
secret society in this part of Ethiopia, for the purpose of sustaining
their kings and ruling the people through their superstition.
By fear and fanaticism these brutal priests exact confessions
from ignorant negroes, which, in due time, are announced to the
public as divinations of the oracle. The members of the society
are the depositories of many secrets, tricks, and medical preparations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg&nbsp;271]</a></span>
by which they are enabled to paralyze the body as well as
affect the mind of their victim. The king and his chiefs are generally
supreme in this brotherhood of heathen superstition, and
the purity of the sacrificed virgin, in the ceremony just described
was unquestionably yielded to her brutal prince.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI.</h2>


<p>I have always regretted that I left Ayudah on my homeward
voyage without interpreters to aid in the necessary intercourse
with our slaves. There was no one on board who understood a
word of their dialect. Many complaints from the negroes that
would have been dismissed or satisfactorily adjusted, had we
comprehended their vivacious tongues and grievances, were passed
over in silence or hushed with the lash. Indeed, the whip
alone was the emblem of La Estrella&rsquo;s discipline; and in the end
it taught me the saddest of lessons.</p>

<p>From the beginning there was manifest discontent among the
slaves. I endeavored at first to please and accommodate them
by a gracious manner; but manner alone is not appreciated by
untamed Africans. A few days after our departure, a slave leaped
overboard in a fit of passion, and another choked himself during
the night. These two suicides, in twenty-four hours, caused
much uneasiness among the officers, and induced me to make
every preparation for a revolt.</p>

<p>We had been at sea about three weeks without further disturbance,
and there was so much merriment among the gangs
that were allowed to come on deck, that my apprehensions of
danger began gradually to wear away. Suddenly, however, one
fair afternoon, a squall broke forth from an almost cloudless sky;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg&nbsp;273]</a></span>
and as the boatswain&rsquo;s whistle piped all hands to take in sail, a
simultaneous rush was made by the confined slaves at all the
after-gratings, and amid the confusion of the rising gale, they
knocked down the guard and poured upon deck. The sentry
at the <i>fore-hatch</i> seized the cook&rsquo;s axe, and sweeping it round
him like a scythe, kept at bay the band that sought to emerge
from below him. Meantime, the women in the cabin were not
idle. Seconding the males, they rose in a body, and the helmsman
was forced to stab several with his knife before he could
drive them below again.</p>

<p>About forty stalwart devils, yelling and grinning with all the
savage ferocity of their wilderness, were now on deck, armed
with staves of broken water-casks, or billets of wood, found in
the hold. The suddenness of this outbreak did not appal me,
for, in the dangerous life of Africa, a trader must be always
admonished and never off his guard. The blow that prostrated
the first white man was the earliest symptom I detected of the
revolt; but, in an instant, I had the arm-chest open on the quarter-deck,
and the mate and steward beside me to protect it.
Matters, however, did not stand so well forward of the mainmast.
Four of the hands were disabled by clubs, while the rest
defended themselves and the wounded as well as they could with
handspikes, or whatever could suddenly be clutched. I had
always charged the cook, on such an emergency, to distribute
from his coppers a liberal supply of scalding water upon the
belligerents; and, at the first sign of revolt, he endeavored to
baptize the heathen with his steaming slush. But dinner had
been over for some time, so that the lukewarm liquid only irritated
the savages, one of whom laid the unfortunate &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;
bleeding in the scuppers.</p>

<p>All this occurred in perhaps less time than I have taken to
tell it; yet, rapid as was the transaction, I saw that, between
the squall with its flying sails, and the revolt with its raving
blacks, we would soon be in a desperate plight, unless I gave the
order <i>to shoot</i>. Accordingly, I told my comrades <i>to aim low and
fire at once</i>.</p>

<p>Our carabines had been purposely loaded with buck-shot, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg&nbsp;274]</a></span>
suit such an occasion, so that the first two discharges brought
several of the rebels to their knees. Still, the unharmed neither
fled or ceased brandishing their weapons. Two more discharges
drove them forward amongst the mass of my crew, who had
retreated towards the bowsprit; but, being reinforced by the
boatswain and carpenter, we took command of the hatches so
effectually, that a dozen additional discharges among the ebony
legs, drove the refractory to their quarters below.</p>

<p>It was time; for sails, ropes, tacks, sheets, and blocks, were
flapping, dashing, and rolling about the masts and decks, threatening
us with imminent danger from the squall. In a short time,
every thing was made snug, the vessel put on our course, and attention
paid to the mutineers, who had begun to fight among
themselves in the hold!</p>

<p>I perceived at once, by the infuriate sounds proceeding from
below, that it would not answer to venture in their midst by
descending through the hatches. Accordingly, we discharged
the women from their quarters under a guard on deck, and sent
several resolute and well-armed hands to remove a couple of
boards from the bulk-head, that separated the cabin from the
hold. When this was accomplished, a party entered, on hands
and knees, through the aperture, and began to press the mutineers
forward towards the bulk-head of the forecastle. Still,
the rebels were hot for fight to the last, and boldly defended
themselves with their staves against our weapons.</p>

<p>By this time, our lamed cook had rekindled his fires, and the
water was once more boiling. The hatches were kept open but
guarded, and all who did not fight were suffered to come singly
on deck, where they were tied. As only about sixty remained
below engaged in conflict, or defying my party of sappers and
miners, I ordered a number of auger-holes to be bored in the
deck, as the scoundrels were forced forward near the forecastle,
when a few buckets of boiling water, rained on them through the
fresh apertures, brought the majority to submission. Still, however,
two of the most savage held out against water as well as
fire. I strove as long as possible to save their lives, but their
resistance was so prolonged and perilous, that we were obliged
to disarm them <i>for ever</i> by a couple of pistol shots.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg&nbsp;275]</a></span>
So ended the sad revolt of &ldquo;La Estrella,&rdquo; in which two of
my men were seriously wounded, while twenty-eight balls and
buck-shot were extracted, with sailors&rsquo; skill, from the lower limbs
of the slaves. One woman and three men perished of blows
received in the conflict; but none were deliberately slain except
the two men, who resisted unto death.</p>

<p>I could never account for this mutiny, especially as the blacks
from Ayudah and its neighborhood are distinguished for their
humble manners and docility. There can be no doubt that the
entire gang was not united or concerned in the original outbreak,
else we should have had harder work in subduing them,
amid the risk and turmoil of a West Indian squall.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg&nbsp;276]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>


<p>There was very little comfort on board La Estrella, after the
suppression of this revolt. We lived with a pent-up volcano
beneath us, and, day and night, we were ceaselessly vigilant.
Terror reigned supreme, and the lash was its sceptre.</p>

<p>At last, we made land at Porto Rico, and were swiftly passing
its beautiful shores, when the inspector called my attention
to the appearance of one of our attendant slaves, whom we had
drilled as a sort of cabin-boy. He was a gentle, intelligent
child, and had won the hearts of all the officers.</p>

<p>His pulse was high, quick and hard; his face and eyes red
and swollen; while, on his neck, I detected half a dozen rosy
pimples. He was sent immediately to the forecastle, free from
contact with any one else, and left there, cut off from the crew,
till I could guard against pestilence. It was small-pox!</p>

<p>The boy passed a wretched night of fever and pain, developing
the malady with all its horrors. It is very likely that I
slept as badly as the sufferer, for my mind was busy with his
<i>doom</i>. Daylight found me on deck in consultation with our
veteran boatswain, whose experience in the trade authorized the
highest respect for his opinion. Hardened as he was, the old
man&rsquo;s eyes filled, his lips trembled, and his voice was husky, as
he whispered the verdict in my ear. I guessed it before he said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg&nbsp;277]</a></span>
a word; yet I hoped he would have counselled against the dread
alternative. As we went aft to the quarter-deck, all eyes were
bent upon us, for every one conjectured the malady and feared
the result, yet none dared ask a question.</p>

<p>I ordered a general inspection of the slaves, yet when a
<i>favorable</i> report was made, I did not rest content, and descended
to examine each one personally. It was true; the child was
<i>alone</i> infected!</p>

<p>For half an hour, I trod the deck to and fro restlessly, and
caused the crew to subject themselves to inspection. But my
sailors were as healthy as the slaves. There was no symptom
that indicated approaching danger. I was disappointed again.
A single case&mdash;a single sign of peril in any quarter, would have
spared the poison!</p>

<p>That evening, in the stillness of night, a trembling hand stole
forward to the afflicted boy with a potion that knows no waking.
In a few hours, all was over. Life and the pestilence were
crushed together; for a necessary murder had been committed,
and the poor victim was beneath the blue water!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I am not superstitious, but a voyage attended with such
calamities could not end happily. Incessant gales and head
winds, unusual in this season and latitude, beset us so obstinately,
that it became doubtful whether our food and water
would last till we reached Matanzas. To add to our risks and
misfortunes, a British corvette espied our craft, and gave chase
off Cape Maize. All day long she dogged us slowly, but, at
night, I tacked off shore, with the expectation of eluding my
pursuer. Day-dawn, however, revealed her again on our track,
though this time we had unfortunately fallen to leeward. Accordingly,
I put La Estrella directly before the wind, and ran
till dark with a fresh breeze, when I again dodged the cruiser,
and made for the Cuban coast. But the Briton seemed to scent
my track, for sunrise revealed him once more in chase.</p>

<p>The wind lulled that night to a light breeze, yet the red
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg&nbsp;278]</a></span>
clouds and haze in the east betokened a gale from that quarter
before meridian. A longer pursuit must have given considerable
advantage to the enemy, so that my best reliance, I calculated,
was in making the small harbor near St. Jago, now about twenty
miles distant, where I had already landed two cargoes. The
corvette was then full ten miles astern.</p>

<p>My resolution to save the cargo and lose the vessel was
promptly made;&mdash;orders were issued to strike from the slaves
the irons they had constantly worn since the mutiny; the boats
were made ready; and every man prepared his bag for a rapid
launch.</p>

<p>On dashed the cruiser, foaming at the bows, under the impetus
of the rising gale, which struck him some time before it
reached us. We were not more than seven miles apart when the
first increased pressure on our sails was felt, and every thing
was set and braced to give it the earliest welcome. Then came
the tug and race for the beach, three miles ahead. But, under
such circumstances, it was hardly to be expected that St. George
could carry the day. Still, every nerve was strained to effect
the purpose. Regardless of the gale, reef after reef was let out
while force pumps moistened his sails; yet nothing was gained.
Three miles against seven were too much odds;&mdash;and, with a
slight move of the helm, and &ldquo;letting all fly,&rdquo; as we neared the
line of surf, to break her headway, La Estrella was fairly and
safely <i>beached</i>.</p>

<p>The sudden shock snapped her mainmast like a pipe-stem,
but, as no one was injured, in a twinkling the boats were overboard,
crammed with women and children, while a stage was
rigged from the bows to the strand, so that the males, the crew
and the luggage were soon in charge of my old <i>haciendado</i>.</p>

<p>Prompt as we were, we were not sufficiently so for the cruiser.
Half our cargo was ashore when she backed her topsails off the
mouth of the little bay, lowered her boats, filled them with
boarders, and steered towards our craft. The delay of half a
mile&rsquo;s row gave us time to cling still longer to the wreck, so
that, when the boats and corvette began to fire, we wished them
joy of their bargain over the remnant of our least valuable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg&nbsp;279]</a></span>
negroes. The rescued blacks are now, in all likelihood, citizens of
Jamaica; but, under the influence of the gale, La Estrella made
a very picturesque bonfire, as we saw it that night from the
<i>azot&eacute;a</i> of our landlord&rsquo;s domicile.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg&nbsp;280]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>


<p>Disastrous as was this enterprise, both on the sea and in the
counting-house, a couple of months found me on board a splendid
clipper,&mdash;born of the famous waters of the Chesapeake,&mdash;delighting
in the name of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Aguila de Oro</span>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Golden Eagle,&rdquo; and spinning
out of the Cape de Verds on a race with a famous West Indian
privateer.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Montesquieu&rdquo; was the pride of Jamaica for pluck and
sailing, when folks of her character were not so unpopular as of
late among the British Islands; and many a banter passed between
her commander and myself, while I was unsuccessfully
waiting till the governor resolved his conscientious difficulties
about the <i>exchange of flags</i>. At last I offered a bet of five hundred
dollars against an equal sum; and next day a bag with the
tempting thousand was tied to the end of my mainboom, with an
invitation for the boaster to &ldquo;follow and take.&rdquo; It was understood
that, once clear of the harbor, the &ldquo;Aguila&rdquo; should have
five minutes&rsquo; start of the Montesquieu, after which we were to
crowd sail and begin the race.</p>

<p>The contest was quickly noised throughout the port, and the
captains smacked their lips over the <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> promised by the
boaster out of the five hundred dollars won from the &ldquo;Yankee
nutshell.&rdquo; Accordingly, when all was ready and the breeze
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg&nbsp;281]</a></span>
favored, the eastern cliffs of the Isle were crowded with spectators
to witness the regatta.</p>

<p>As we were first at sea and clear of the harbor, we delayed
for our antagonist; and without claiming the conceded start of
five minutes, did not shoot ahead till our rival was within musket
shot. But <i>then</i> the tug began with a will; and as the Aguila
led, I selected her most favorable trim and kept her two points
free. The Montesquieu did the same, but confident of her speed,
did not spread all her canvas that would draw. The error, however,
was soon seen. Our Chesapeake clipper crawled off as if
her opponent was at anchor; and in a jiffy every thing that could
be carried was sheeted home and braced to a hair. The breeze
was steady and strong. Soon the island was cleared entirely;
and by keeping away another point, I got out of the Aguila her
utmost capacity as a racer. As she led off, the Montesquieu followed,&mdash;but
glass by glass, and hour by hour, the distance between
us increased, till at sunset the boaster&rsquo;s hull was below the
horizon, and my bag taken in as a lawful prize.</p>

<p>I did not return to Praya after this adventure, but keeping
on towards the coast, in four days entered the Rio Salum, an independent
river between the French island of Goree and the
British possessions on the Gambia. No slaver had haunted this
stream for many a year, so that I was obliged to steer my mosquito
pilot-boat full forty miles in the interior, through mangroves
and forests, till I struck the trading ground of &ldquo;the
king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After three days&rsquo; parley I had just concluded my bargain with
his breechless majesty, when a &ldquo;barker&rdquo; greeted me with the
cheerless message that the &ldquo;Aguila&rdquo; was surrounded by man-of-war
boats! It was true; but the mate refused an inspection of
his craft <i>on neutral ground</i>, and the naval folks departed. Nevertheless,
a week after, when I had just completed my traffic, I was
seized by a gang of the treacherous king&rsquo;s own people; delivered
to the second lieutenant of a French corvette&mdash;&ldquo;La Bayonnaise;&rdquo;&mdash;and
my lovely little Eagle caged as her lawful prey!</p>

<p>I confess I have never been able to understand the legal merits
of this seizure, so far as the act of the French officers was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg&nbsp;282]</a></span>
concerned, as no treaty existed between France and Spain for
the suppression of slavery. The reader will not be surprised to
learn, therefore, that there was a very loud explosion of wrath
among my men when they found themselves prisoners; nor was
their fury diminished when our whole band was forced into a
dungeon at Goree, which, for size, gloom, and closeness, vied with
the celebrated black hole of Calcutta.</p>

<p>For three days were we kept in this filthy receptacle, in a
burning climate, without communication with friends or inhabitants,
and on scanty fare, till it suited the local authorities to
transfer us to San Luis, on the Senegal, in charge of a file of
marines, <i>on board our own vessel</i>!</p>

<p>San Luis is the residence of the governor and the seat of
the colonial tribunal, and here again we were incarcerated in a
military <i>cach&ocirc;t</i>, till several merchants who knew me on the Rio
Pongo, interfered, and had us removed to better quarters in the
military hospital. I soon learned that there was trouble among
the natives. A war had broken out among some of the Moorish
tribes, some two hundred miles up the Senegal, and my Aguila
was a godsend to the Frenchmen, who needed just such a light
craft to guard their returning flotilla with merchandise from Gatam.
Accordingly, the craft was armed, manned, and despatched
on this expedition <i>without waiting the decree of a court as to
the lawfulness of her seizure</i>!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the sisters of charity&mdash;those angels of devoted
mercy, who do not shun even the heats and pestilence of Africa,&mdash;made
our prison life as comfortable as possible; and had we
not seen gratings at the windows, or met a sentinel when we attempted
to go out, we might have considered ourselves valetudinarians
instead of convicts.</p>

<p>A month oozed slowly away in these headquarters of suffering,
before a military sergeant apprised us that he had been elevated
to the dignity of the long-robe, and appointed our counsel in the
approaching trial. No other lawyer was to be had in the colony
for love or money, and, perhaps, our military man might have
acquitted himself as well as the best, had not his superiors often
imposed silence on him during the argument.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg&nbsp;283]</a></span>
By this time the nimble Aguila had made two most serviceable
trips under the French officers, and proved so valuable to the
Gallic government that no one dreamed of recovering her. The
colonial authorities had two alternatives under the circumstances,&mdash;either
to pay for or condemn her,&mdash;and as they knew I would
not be willing to take the craft again after the destruction of my
voyage, the formality of a trial was determined to legalize the
condemnation. It was necessary, however, even in Africa, to
show that I had violated the territory of the French colony by
trading in slaves, and that the Aguila had been caught in
the act.</p>

<p>I will not attempt a description of the court scene, in which
my military friend was browbeaten by the prosecutor, the prosecutor
by the judge, and the judge by myself. After various outrages
and absurdities, a Mahometan <i>slave</i> was allowed to be
sworn as a witness against me; whereupon I burst forth with a
torrent of argument, defence, abuse, and scorn, till a couple of
soldiers were called to keep my limbs and tongue in forensic
order.</p>

<p>But the deed was done. The foregone conclusion was formally
announced. The Aguila de Oro became King Louis Philippe&rsquo;s
property, while my men were condemned to two, my
officers to five, and Don T&eacute;odor himself, to ten years&rsquo; confinement
in the central prisons of <i>la belle France</i>!</p>

<p>Such was the style of colonial justice in the reign of <i>le roi
bourgeois</i>!</p>

<p>My sentence aroused the indignation of many respectable merchants
at San Luis; and, of course, I did not lack kindly visits
in the stronghold to which I was reconducted. It was found to
be entirely useless to attack the sympathy of the tribunal, either
to procure a rehearing of the cause or mitigation of the judgment.
Presently, a generous friend introduced <i>a saw</i> suitable to
discuss the toughness of iron bars, and hinted that on the night
when my window gratings were severed, a boat might be found
waiting to transport me to the opposite shore of the river, whence
an independent chief would convey me on camels to Gambia.</p>

<p>I know not how it was that the government got wind of my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg&nbsp;284]</a></span>
projected flight, but it certainly did, and we were sent on board
a station ship lying in the stream. Still my friends did not
abandon me. I was apprised that a party,&mdash;bound on a shooting
frolic down the river on the first <i>foggy</i> morning,&mdash;would visit
the commander of the hulk,&mdash;a noted <i>bon vivant</i>,&mdash;and while the
vessel was surrounded by a crowd of boats, I might slip overboard
amid the confusion. Under cover of the dense mist that
shrouds the surface of an African river at dawn, I could easily
elude even a ball if sent after me, and when I reached the shore,
a canoe would be ready to convey me to a friendly ship.</p>

<p>The scheme was peculiarly feasible, as the captain happened
to be a good fellow, and allowed me unlimited liberty about his
vessel. Accordingly, when the note had been duly digested, I
called my officers apart, and proposed their participation in my
escape. The project was fully discussed by the fellows; but the
risk of swimming, even in a fog, under the muzzles of muskets,
was a danger they feared encountering. I perceived at once that
it would be best to free myself entirely from the encumbrance of
such chicken-hearted lubbers, so I bade them take their own
course, but divided three thousand francs in government bills
among the gang, and presented my gold pocket chronometer to
the mate.</p>

<p>Next morning an impervious fog laid low on the bosom of the
Senegal, but through its heavy folds I detected the measured
beat of approaching oars, till five boats, with a sudden rush,
dashed alongside us with their noisy and clamorous crews.</p>

<p>Just at this very moment a friendly hand passed through
my arm, and a gentle tone invited me to a quarter-deck promenade.
It was our captain!</p>

<p>There was, of course, no possibility of declining the proffered
civility, for during the whole of my detention on board, the commander
had treated me with the most assiduous politeness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Mon cher Canot</i>,&rdquo; said he, as soon as we got aft,&mdash;&ldquo;you
seem to take considerable interest in these visitors of ours, and I
wish from the bottom of my heart that you could join the sport;
<i>but, unfortunately for you, these gentlemen will not effect their
purpose</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg&nbsp;285]</a></span>
As I did not entirely comprehend,&mdash;though I rather guessed,&mdash;his
precise meaning, I made an evasive answer; and, arm in
arm I was led from the deck to the cabin. When we were perfectly
alone, he pointed to a seat, and frankly declared that I
had been betrayed by a Judas to his sergeant of marines! I was
taken perfectly aback, as I imagined myself almost free, yet the
loss of liberty did not paralyze me as much as the perfidy of my
men. Like a stupid booby, I stood gazing with a fixed stare at
the captain, when the cabin door burst open, and with a shout
of joyous merriment the hunters rushed in to greet their
comrade.</p>

<p>My dress that morning was a very elaborate <i>neglig&eacute;</i>. I had
purposely omitted coat, braces, stockings and shoes, so that my
privateer costume of trowsers and shirt was not calculated for
the reception of strangers. It was natural, therefore, that the
first sally of my friendly liberators should be directed against my
toilette; I parried it, however, as adroitly as my temper would
allow, by reproaching them with their &ldquo;unseasonable visit,
before I could complete the <i>bath</i> which they saw I was prepared
for!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hint was understood; but the captain thought proper to
tell the entire tale. No man, he said, would have been happier
than he, had I escaped before the treachery. My friends were
entreated not to risk further attempts, which might subject me
to severe restraints; and my base comrades were forthwith summoned
to the cabin, where, in presence of the merchants, they
were forced to disgorge the three thousand francs and the chronometer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this,&rdquo; said Captain Z&mdash;&mdash;, &ldquo;is not to be the end of
the comedy,&mdash;<i>en avant, messieurs</i>!&rdquo; as he led the way to the
mess-room, where a sumptuous <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> was spread for officers
and huntsmen, and over its fragrant fumes my disappointment
was, for a while, forgotten.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg&nbsp;286]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV.</h2>


<p>For fifteen days more the angry captive bit his thumbs on
the taffrail of the guard-ship, and gazed either at vacancy or
the waters of the Senegal. At the end of that period, a
gunboat transferred our convict party to the frigate Flora,
whose first lieutenant, to whom I had been privately recommended,
separated me immediately from my men. The scoundrels
were kept close prisoners during the whole voyage to
France, while my lot was made as light as possible, under the
severe sentence awarded at San Luis.</p>

<p>The passage was short. At Brest, they landed me privately,
while my men and officers were paraded through the streets at
mid-day, under a file of <i>gens d&rsquo;armes</i>. I am especially grateful
to the commander of this frigate, who alleviated my sufferings
by his generous demeanor in every respect, and whose representations
to the government of France caused my sentence to
be subsequently modified to simple imprisonment.</p>

<p>I have so many pleasant recollections of this voyage as a
convict in the Flora, that I am loth to recount the following
anecdote; yet I hardly think it ought to be omitted, for it is
characteristic in a double aspect. It exhibits at once the chivalric
courtesy and the coarse boorishness of some classes in the
naval service of France, at the period I am describing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg&nbsp;287]</a></span>
On board our frigate there were two Sisters of Charity, who
were returning to their parent convent in France, after five years
of colonial self-sacrifice in the pestilential marshes of Africa.
These noble women lodged in a large state-room, built expressly
for their use and comfort on the lower battery-deck, and, according
to the ship&rsquo;s rule, were entitled to mess with the lieutenants
in their wardroom. It so happened, that among the officers, there
was one of those vulgar dolts, whose happiness consists in making
others as uncomfortable as possible, both by bullying manners
and lewd conversation. He seemed to delight in losing no opportunity
to offend the ladies while at table, by ridiculing their
calling and piety; yet, not content with these insults, which the
nuns received with silent contempt, he grew so bold on one occasion,
in the midst of dinner, as to burst forth with a song so
gross, that it would have disgraced the orgies of a <i>cabaret</i>. The
Sisters instantly arose, and, next morning, refused their meals
in the wardroom, soliciting the steward to supply them a sailor&rsquo;s
ration in their cabin, where they might be free from dishonor.</p>

<p>But the charitable women were soon missed from mess, and
when the steward&rsquo;s report brought the dangerous idea of a court-martial
before the terrified imagination of the vulgarians, a
prompt resolve was made to implore pardon for the indecent officer,
before the frigate&rsquo;s captain could learn the outrage. It is
needless to add that the surgeon&mdash;who was appointed ambassador&mdash;easily
obtained the mercy of these charitable women, and
that, henceforth, our lieutenants&rsquo; wardroom was a model of social
propriety.</p>


<h3>THE PRISON OF BREST.</h3>

<p>I was not very curious in studying the architecture of the
strong stone lock-up, to which they conducted me in the stern
and ugly old rendezvous of Brest. I was sick as soon as I
beheld it from our deck. The entrance to the harbor, through
the long, narrow, rocky strait, defended towards the sea by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg&nbsp;288]</a></span>
frowning castle, and strongly fortified towards the land, looked
to me like passing through the throat of a monster, who was to
swallow me for ever. But I had little time for observation or
reflection on external objects,&mdash;my business was with <i>interiors</i>:
and when the polite midshipman with whom I landed bade farewell,
it was only to transfer me to the <i>conci&egrave;rge</i> of a prison
within the royal arsenal. Here I was soon joined by the crew
and officers. For a while, I rejected their penitence; but a man
who is suddenly swept from the wild liberty of Africa, and
doomed for ten years to penitential seclusion, becomes wonderfully
forgiving when loneliness eats into his heart, and eternal
silence makes the sound of his own voice almost insupportable.
One by one, therefore, was restored at least to sociability; so
that, when I embraced the permission of our keeper to quit my
cell, and move about the prison bounds, I found myself surrounded
by seventy or eighty marines and seamen, who were
undergoing the penalties of various crimes. The whole establishment
was under the <i>surveillance</i> of a naval commissary, subject
to strict regulations. In due time, two spacious rooms were
assigned for my gang, while the jailer, who turned out to be an
amphibious scamp,&mdash;half sailor, half soldier,&mdash;assured us, &ldquo;on
the honor of a <i>vieux militaire</i>,&rdquo; that his entire jurisdiction should
be our limits so long as we behaved with propriety.</p>

<p>Next day I descended to take exercise in a broad court-yard,
over whose lofty walls the fresh blue sky looked temptingly; and
was diligently chewing the cud of bitter fancies, when a stout
elderly man, in shabby uniform, came to a military halt before
me, and, abruptly saluting in regulation style, desired the favor
of a word.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Pardon, mon br&acirc;ve!</i>&rdquo; said the intruder, &ldquo;but I should be
charmed if <i>Monsieur le capitaine</i> will honor me by the information
whether it has been his lot to enjoy the accommodations of
a French prison, prior to the unlucky mischance which gives us
the delight of his society!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I, sulkily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Encore</i>,&rdquo; continued the questioner, &ldquo;will it be disagreeable,
if I improve this opportunity, by apprising Monsieur
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg&nbsp;289]</a></span>
<i>le capitaine</i>, on the part of our companions and comrades, of the
regulations of this royal institution?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; returned I, somewhat softer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, <i>mon cher</i>, the sooner you are initiated into the mysteries
of the craft the better, and no one will go through the
ceremony more explicitly, briefly and satisfactorily, than myself&mdash;<i>le
Caporal Blon</i>. First of all, <i>mon br&acirc;ve</i>, and most indispensable,
as your good sense will teach you, it is necessary that
every new comer is bound to pay his footing among the &lsquo;<i>government
boarders</i>;&rsquo; and as you, Monsieur le capitaine, seem to be
the honored <i>chef</i> of this charming little squadron, I will make
bold to thank you for a <i>Louis d&rsquo;or</i>, or a <i>Napoleon</i>, to insure
your welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The request was no sooner out than complied with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Bien!</i>&rdquo; continued the corporal, &ldquo;<i>c&rsquo;est un bon enfant,
parbleu!</i> Now, I have but one more <i>myst&egrave;re</i> to impart, and
that is a regulation which no clever chap disregards. We are
companions in misery; we sleep beneath one roof; we eat out of
one kettle;&mdash;in fact, <i>nous sommes fr&egrave;res</i>, and the <i>secrets of
brothers are sacred, within these walls, from jailers and turnkeys</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he said these words, he pursed up his mouth, bent his
eyes scrutinizingly into mine, and laying his finger on his lip,
brought his right hand once more, with a salute, to the oily remnant
of a military cap.</p>

<p>I was initiated. I gave the required pledge for my party,
and, in return, was assured that, in any enterprise undertaken
for our escape,&mdash;which seemed to be the great object and concern
of every body&rsquo;s prison-life,&mdash;we should be assisted and protected
by our fellow-sufferers.</p>

<p>Most of this day was passed in our rooms, and, at dark, after
being mustered and counted, we were locked up for the night.
For some time we moped and sulked, according to the fashion of
all <i>new</i> convicts, but, at length, we sallied forth in a body to the
court-yard, determined to take the world as it went, and make
the best of a bad bargain.</p>

<p>I soon fell into a pleasant habit of chatting familiarly with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg&nbsp;290]</a></span>
old Corporal Blon, who was grand chamberlain, or master of ceremonies,
to our penal household, and turned out to be a good
fellow, though a frequent offender against &ldquo;<i>le coq de France</i>.&rdquo;
Blon drew me to a seat in the sunshine, which I enjoyed, after
shivering in the cold apartments of the prison; and, stepping off
among the prisoners, began to bring them up for introduction to
Don T&eacute;odor, separately. First of all, I had the honor of receiving
Monsieur Laramie, a stout, stanch, well-built marine,
who professed to be <i>ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;armes</i> of our &ldquo;royal boarding-house,&rdquo;
and tendered his services in teaching me the use of
rapier and broadsword, at the rate of a <i>franc</i> per week. Next
came a burly, beef-eating bully, half sailor, half lubber, who approached
with a swinging gait, and was presented as <i>fr&egrave;re</i> Zouche,
teacher of single stick, who was also willing to make me skilful
in my encounters with footpads for a reasonable salary. Then
followed a dancing-master, a tailor, a violin-teacher, a shoemaker,
a letter-writer, a barber, a clothes-washer, and various
other useful and reputable tradespeople or professors, all of
whom expressed anxiety to inform my mind, cultivate my taste,
expedite nay correspondence, delight my ear, and improve my
appearance, for weekly stipends.</p>

<p>I did not, at first, understand precisely the object of all their
ceremonious appeals to my purse, but I soon discovered from
Corporal Blon,&mdash;<i>who desired an early discount of his note</i>,&mdash;that
I was looked on as a sort of Don Magnifico from Africa,
who had saved an immense quantity of gold from ancient traffic,
all of which I could command, in spite of imprisonment.</p>

<p>So I thought it best not to undeceive the industrious wretches,
and, accordingly, dismissed each of them with a few kind words,
and promised to accept their offers when I became a little more
familiar with my quarters.</p>

<p>After breakfast, I made a tour of the corridors, to see
whether the representations of my morning courtiers were true;
and found the shoemakers and tailors busy over toeless boots
and patchwork garments. One alcove contained the violinist
and dancing-master, giving lessons to several scapegraces in the
<i>terpsichorean</i> art; in another was the letter-writer, laboriously
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg&nbsp;291]</a></span>
adorning a sheet with cupids, hearts, flames, and arrows, while
a love-lorn booby knelt beside him, dictating a message to his
mistress; in a hall I found two pupils of Monsieur Laramie at
<i>quart</i> and <i>ti&egrave;rce</i>; in the corridors I came upon a string of tables,
filled with cigars, snuff, writing-paper, ink, pens, wax, wafers, needles
and thread; while, in the remotest cell, I discovered a pawnbroker
and gambling-table. Who can doubt that a real Gaul
knows how to kill time, when he is unwillingly converted into a
&ldquo;government boarder,&rdquo; and transfers the occupations, amusements,
and vices of life, to the recesses of a prison!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Very soon after my incarceration at Brest, I addressed a
memorial to the Spanish consul, setting forth the afflictions of
twenty-two of his master&rsquo;s subjects, and soliciting the interference
of our ambassador at Paris. We were promptly visited by
the consul and an eminent lawyer, who asserted his ability to
stay proceedings against the ratification of our sentence; but, as
the Spanish minister never thought fit to notice our misfortunes,
the efforts of the lawyer and the good will of our consul were
ineffectual. Three months glided by, while I lingered at Brest;
yet my heart did not sink with hope delayed, for the natural
buoyancy of my spirit sustained me, and I entered with avidity
upon all the schemes and diversions of our stronghold.</p>

<p>Blon kept me busy discounting his twenty <i>sous</i> notes, which
I afterwards always took care to lose to him at cards. Then I
patronized the dancing-master; took two months&rsquo; lessons with
Laramie and Zouche; caused my shoes to be thoroughly mended;
had my clothes repaired and scoured; and, finally, patronized all
the various industries of my comrades, to the extent of two hundred
francs.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of these diversions, an order came
for our immediate transfer to the <i>civil prison</i> of Brest, a gloomy
tower in the walled <i>chateau</i> of that detestable town.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg&nbsp;292]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>


<p>I was taken from one prison to the other in a boat, and once
more spared the mortification of a parade through the streets,
under a guard of soldiers.</p>

<p>A receipt was given for the whole squad to the <i>brigadier</i> who
chaperoned us. My men were summarily distributed by the
jailer among the cells already filled with common malefactors;
but, as the appearance of the <i>officers</i> indicated the possession of
cash, the turnkey offered &ldquo;<i>la salle de distinction</i>&rdquo; for our use,
provided we were satisfied with a monthly rent of ten <i>francs</i>.
I thought the French government was bound to find suitable
accommodations for an involuntary guest, and that it was rather
hard to imprison me first, and make me pay board afterwards;
but, on reflection, I concluded to accept the offer, hard as it was,
and, accordingly, we took possession of a large apartment, with
two grated windows looking upon a narrow and sombre court-yard.</p>

<p>We had hardly entered the room, when a buxom woman followed
with the deepest curtseys, and declared herself &ldquo;most
happy to have it in her power to supply us with beds and bedding,
at ten sous per day.&rdquo; She apprised us, moreover, that the
daily prison fare consisted of two pounds and a half of black
bread, with water <i>&agrave; discretion</i>, but if we wished, she might introduce
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg&nbsp;293]</a></span>
the <i>vivandi&egrave;re</i> of the regiment, stationed in the chateau,
who would supply our meals twice a day from the mess of the
petty officers.</p>

<p>My money had not been seriously moth-eaten during our previous
confinement, so that I did not hesitate to strike a bargain
with Madame Sorret, and to request that <i>la vivandi&egrave;re</i> might
make her appearance on the theatre of action as soon as possible.
Presently, the door opened again, and the dame reappeared accompanied
by two Spanish women, wives of musicians in the
corps, who had heard that several of their countrymen had that
morning been incarcerated, and availed themselves of the earliest
chance to visit and succor them.</p>

<p>For the thousandth time I blessed the noble heart that ever
beats in the breast of a Spanish woman when distress or calamity
appeals, and at once proceeded to arrange the diet of our future
prison life. We were to have two meals a day of three dishes,
for each of which we were to pay fifteen <i>sous in advance</i>. The
bargain made, we sat down on the floor for a chat.</p>

<p>My brace of Catalan visitors had married in this regiment
when the Duke d&rsquo;Angoul&ecirc;me marched his troops into Spain; and
like faithful girls, followed their husbands in all their meanderings
about France since the regiment&rsquo;s return. As two of my officers
were Catalonians by birth, a friendship sprang up like wildfire
between us, and from that hour, these excellent women not only
visited us daily, but ran our errands, attended to our health,
watched us like sisters, and procured all those little comforts
which the tender soul of the sex can alone devise.</p>

<p>I hope that few of my readers have personal knowledge of
the treatment or fare of civil prisons in the provinces of France
during the republican era of which I am writing. I think it well
to set down a record of its barbarity.</p>

<p>As I before said, the <i>regular ration</i> consisted exclusively of
black bread and water. Nine pounds of straw were allowed
weekly to each prisoner for his <i>lair</i>. Neither blankets nor covering
were furnished, even in the winter, and as the cells are
built without stoves or chimneys, the wretched convicts were
compelled to huddle together in heaps to keep from perishing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg&nbsp;294]</a></span>
Besides this, the government denied all supplies of fresh raiment,
so that the wretches who were destitute of friends or
means, were alive and hideous with vermin in a few days after
incarceration. No amusement was allowed in the fresh air save
twice a week, when the prisoners were turned out on the flat roof
of the tower, where they might sun themselves for an hour or two
under the muzzle of a guard.</p>

<p>Such was the treatment endured by twelve of my men during
the year they continued in France. There are some folks who
may be charitable enough to remark&mdash;<i>that slavers deserved no
better!</i></p>

<p>I believe that convicts in the central prisons of France, where
they were either made or allowed to work, fared better in every
respect than in the provincial lock-ups on the coast. There is no
doubt, however, that the above description at the epoch of my incarceration,
was entirely true of all the smaller jurisdictions,
whose culprits were simply doomed to confinement without labor.</p>

<p>Often did my heart bleed for the poor sailors, whom I aided
to the extent of prudence from my slender means, when I knew
not how long it might be my fate to remain an inmate of the
chateau. After these unfortunate men had disposed of all their
spare garments to obtain now and then a meagre soup to moisten
their stony loaves, they were nearly a year without tasting
either meat or broth! Once only,&mdash;on the anniversary of
<span class="smcap">St. Philippe</span>,&mdash;the Sisters of Charity gave them a pair of bullock&rsquo;s
heads to make a<i>festival</i> in honor of the Good King of the
French!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg&nbsp;295]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI.</h2>


<p>As the apartment rented by us from the jailer was the only one
in the prison he had a right to dispose of for his own benefit, several
other culprits, able to pay for comfortable lodgings, were
from time to time locked up in it. These occasional visitors afforded
considerable entertainment for our seclusion, as they were
often persons of quality arrested for petty misdemeanors or political
opinions, and sometimes <i>chevaliers d&rsquo;industrie</i>, whose professional
careers were rich with anecdote and adventure.</p>

<p>It was probably a month after we began our intimacy with
this &ldquo;government boarding-house&rdquo; that our number was increased
by a gentleman of cultivated manners and foppish costume.
He was, perhaps, a little too much over-dressed with chains,
trinkets, and perfumed locks, to be perfectly <i>comme il faut</i>, yet
there was an intellectual power about his forehead and eyes, and
a bewitching smile on his lips, that insinuated themselves into
my heart the moment I beheld him. He was precisely the sort
of man who is considered by nine tenths of the world as a very
&ldquo;fascinating individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, I welcomed the stranger most cordially in
French, and was still more bewitched by the retiring shyness of
his modest demeanor. As the jailer retired, a wink signified
his desire to commune with me apart in his office, where I learned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg&nbsp;296]</a></span>
that the new comer had been arrested under a charge of <i>counterfeiting</i>,
but on account of his genteel appearance and blood, was
placed in our apartment. I had no doubt that neither appearance
nor blood had been the springs of sympathy in the jailer&rsquo;s heart,
but that the artificial money-maker had judiciously used certain
lawful coins to insure better quarters. Nevertheless, I did not
hesitate to approve the turnkey&rsquo;s disposal of the suspected felon,
and begged him to make no apologies or give himself concern as
to the quality of the article that could afford us a moment&rsquo;s
amusement in our dreary den.</p>

<p>I next proceeded to initiate my gentleman into the mysteries
of the <i>chateau</i>; and as dinner was about serving, I suggested that
the most important of our domestic rites on such occasions, imperatively
required three or four bottles of first-rate claret.</p>

<p>By this time we had acquired a tolerable knack of &ldquo;slaughtering
the evening.&rdquo; Our Spanish girls supplied us with guitars
and violins, which my comrades touched with some skill. We
were thus enabled to give an occasional <i>soir&eacute;e dansante</i>, assisted
by la Vivandi&egrave;re, her companions Dolorescita, Concha, Madame
Sorret, and an old maid who passed for her sister. The arrival
of the counterfeiter enabled us to make up a full cotillon without
the musicians. Our <i>soir&eacute;es</i>, enlivened by private contributions
and a bottle or two of wine, took place on Thursdays and Sundays,
while the rest of the week was passed in playing cards,
reading romances, writing petitions, flirting with the girls, and
cursing our fate and the French government. Fits of wrath
against the majesty of Gaul were more frequent in the early
morning, when the pleasant sleeper would be suddenly roused
from happy dreams by the tramp of soldiers and grating bolts,
which announced the unceremonious entrance of our inspector to
count his cattle and sound our window gratings.</p>

<p>But time wastes one&rsquo;s cash as well as one&rsquo;s patience in prison.
The more we grumbled, danced, drank, and eat, the more we spent
or lavished, so that my funds looked very like a thin sediment
at the bottom of the purse, when I began to reflect upon means of
replenishing. I could not beg; I was master of no handicraft;
nor was I willing to descend among the vermin of the common
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg&nbsp;297]</a></span>
chain-gang. Shame prevented an application to my relatives in
France or Italy; and when I addressed my old partner or former
friends in Cuba, I was not even favored with a reply. At last,
my little trinkets and gold chronometer were sacrificed to pay
the lawyer for a <i>final memorial</i> and to liquidate a week&rsquo;s
lodging in advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>mon enfant</i>,&rdquo; said Madame Sorret, as she took my
money,&mdash;trimming her cap, and looking at me with that thrifty
interest that a Frenchwoman always knows how to turn to the
best account;&mdash;&ldquo;now, mon enfant,&mdash;this is your last <i>franc</i> and
your last week in my apartment, you say;&mdash;your last week in
a room where you and I, and Babette, Dolorescita, and Concha,
and <i>Monsieur</i>, have had such good times! <i>Mais pourquoi, mon
cher?</i> why shall it be your last week? Come let us think a bit.
Won&rsquo;t it be a thousand times better; won&rsquo;t it do you a vast
deal more good,&mdash;if instead of <i>sacr&eacute;-ing le bon Louis Philippe</i>,&mdash;paying
lawyers for memorials that are never read,&mdash;hoping for
letters from the Spanish envoy which never come, and eating
your heart up in spite and bitterness&mdash;you look the matter plump
in the face like a man, and not like a <i>polisson</i>, and turn to account
those talents which it has pleased <i>le bon Dieu</i> to give
you? Voyez vous, <i>Capitaine T&eacute;odore</i>,&mdash;you speak foreign languages
like a native; and it was no longer than yesterday that
Monsieur Randanne, your advocate, as he came down from the
last interview with you, stopped at my bureau, and&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! Madame
Sorret,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what a linguist poor Canot is,&mdash;how delightfully
he speaks English, and how glad I should be if he had
any place in which he could teach my sons the noble tongue of
the great <span class="smcap">Skatspeer</span>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>mon capitaine</i>,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;what the good Randanne
said, has been growing in my mind ever since, like the
salad seed in the box that is sunned in our prison yard. In
fact, I have fixed the matter perfectly. You shall have my bed-room
for a schoolhouse; and, if you will, you may begin to-morrow
with my two sons for pupils, at fifteen <i>francs</i> a month!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did I not bless the wit and heart of woman again and again
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg&nbsp;298]</a></span>
in my joy of industrial deliverance! The heart of woman&mdash;that
noble heart! burn it in the fire of Africa; steep it in the snow of
Sweden; lap it in the listless elysium of Indian tropics; cage it
in the centre of dungeons, as the palpitating core of that stony
rind,&mdash;yet every where and always, throughout my wild career,
has it been the last sought&mdash;but surest, sweetest, and truest of
devoted friends!</p>

<p><i>Aide toi, et Dieu t&rsquo;aidera!</i>&mdash;was my motto from that moment.
For years it was the first lesson of intellectual power and
self-reliance that had checkered a life of outlawry, in which adventurous
impatience preferred the gambling risks of fortune to
the slow accretions of regular toil. I was a schoolmaster!</p>

<p>Madame Sorret&rsquo;s plan was perfectly successful. In less than
a week I was installed in her chamber, with a class formed of my
lady&rsquo;s lads, a son and friend of my lawyer, and a couple of sons
of officers in the chateau; the whole producing a monthly income
of fifty francs. As I assumed my vocation with the spirit of a
needy professor, I gained the good will of all the parents by
assiduous instruction of their children. Gradually I extended
the sphere of my usefulness, by adding penmanship to my other
branches of tuition; and so well did I please the parents, that
they volunteered a stipend of eighteen <i>francs</i> more.</p>

<p>I would not dare affirm, that my pupils made extraordinary
progress; yet I am sure the children not only acquired cleverly,
but loved me as a companion. My scheme of instruction was
not modelled upon that of other pedagogues; for I simply contented
myself, in the small class, with reasoning out each lesson
thoroughly, and never allowing the boys to depart till they comprehended
every part of their task. After this, it was my habit to
engage their interest <i>in language</i>, by familiar dialogues, which
taught them the names of furniture, apparel, instruments, implements,
animals, occupations, trades; and thus I led them insensibly
from the most simple nomenclature to the most abstract.
I deprived the interview, as much as I could, of task-like formality;
and invariably closed the school with a story from my
travels or adventures. I may not have ripened my scholars into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg&nbsp;299]</a></span>
classical Anglo-Saxons, but I have the happiness to know that I
earned an honest living, supported my companions, and obtained
the regard of my pupils to such a degree, that the little band
accompanied me with tears to the ship, when, long afterwards, I
was sent a happy exile from France.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII.</h2>


<p>I have said that our genteel felon was not only refined in manners
but shy towards his new companions; nor, for several weeks,
could all our efforts rub off his reserve. I was not surprised that
he kept aloof from the coarser inmates, but I was not prepared
to find that all my own advances to confidence and companionship,
were repulsed with even more decision than those of my officers.
At last, some passing event disclosed my <i>true</i> character to him,
when I learned for the first time that he had mistaken me for <i>a
government spy</i>; inasmuch as he could not otherwise account for
my intimacy with Madame Sorret and her spouse.</p>

<p>Our first move towards confidence was owing to the following
circumstance. I had been engaged one forenoon in writing
a letter to my mother, when Madame Sorret sent for me to see the
Sisters of Charity, who were making their rounds with a few
comforts for the convicts. I made my toilette and repaired to
the parlor, where the charitable women, who heard many kind
things of me from the landlady, bestowed a liberal donation of
books. Returning quickly to my letter, which I had left open
on the table, confident that no one in the room read Italian, I
again took up my pen to finish a paragraph. But, as I observed
the page, it seemed that I had not written so much, yet the sheet
was nearly full of words, and all in my handwriting. I reperused
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg&nbsp;301]</a></span>
the document and found several lines, which, though in perfect
keeping with the sense and context of the composition, were certainly
not in my natural style. I was sure I had not used the
complimentary language, to which I am always so averse. Still
I read the page again&mdash;again&mdash;and again! I got up; walked
about the room; took the paper to the window; put it down;
walked about again, and then reperused the letter. For my life,
I could not detect the precise difficulty that puzzled me. The
paper was, perhaps, bewitched! It was mine, and yet it was not!
In my dilemma, I rolled out a round Spanish <i>carramba</i> or two;
and, with an <i>Ave Maria</i> of utter bewilderment, begun to put up
my writing materials.</p>

<p>My companions, who had been huddled in a corner, watching
my actions, could stand it no longer, but bursting into peals of
hearty laughter, announced that Monsieur Germaine had taken
the liberty to add a postscript, while I was deep in literature
with the Sisters of Charity!</p>

<p>The ice was broken! Monsieur Germaine was not yet convicted,
so we gave him the benefit of the British law, and resolving
to &ldquo;consider the fellow innocent till proved to be guilty,&rdquo; we
raised him to the dignity of companionship. His education
was far superior to mine, and his conversational powers were
wonderful. He seemed perfectly familiar with Latin and Greek,
and had a commanding knowledge of history, theology, mathematics,
and astronomy. I never met his equal in penmanship,
drawing, and designing.</p>

<p>A few days of sociability sufficed to win a mutual confidence,
and to demand the mutual stories of our lives.</p>

<p>Germaine was born so high up on those picturesque borders
of Piedmont, that it was difficult to say whether the Swiss or
Italian predominated in his blood. The troubles and wars of
the region impoverished his parents, who had been gentlefolks in
better times; yet they managed to bestow the culture that made
him the accomplished person I have described. No opportunity
offered, however, for his advancement as he reached maturity,
and it was thought best that he should go abroad in search of
fortune. For a while the quiet and modest youth was successful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg&nbsp;302]</a></span>
in the humbler employments to which he stooped for bread; but
his address and talents, and especially his skill in designing and
penmanship, attracted the notice of a sharper, with whom he
accidentally became intimate; so that, before he knew it, the
adroit scrivener was both <i>used</i> and <i>compromised</i> by the knave.
In truth, I do not suppose that Germaine&rsquo;s will was made of
stern and tough materials. Those soft and gentle beings are
generally disposed to grasp the pleasures of life without labor;
and whenever a relaxed conscience has once allowed its possessor
to tamper with crime, its success is not only a stimulant but a
motive for farther enterprise. Germaine was soon a successful
forger. He amassed twenty or thirty thousand <i>francs</i> by practices
so perfect in their execution, that he never dreamed of
detection. But, at last, a daring speculation made him our companion
in the tower.</p>

<p>Three days before his introduction to the <i>chateau</i> of Brest,
and a few hours before the regular departure of the Paris mail,
Germaine called on an exchange broker with seventeen thousand
<i>francs</i> in gold, with which he purchased a sight draft on the
capital. Soon after he called a second time on the broker, and
exhibiting a letter of orders, bearing a regular post-mark, from
his principals, who were alleged to be oil merchants at Marseilles,
desired to countermand the transaction, and receive back
his gold for the bill of exchange which he tendered. The principal
partner of the brokers did not happen to be within at the
moment, and the junior declined complying till his return. <i>En
attendant</i>, Monsieur Germaine sallied forth, and offered a neighboring
broker an additional half per cent, on the current value
of gold for the cash. He expressed, as the cause of this sacrifice,
extreme anxiety to depart by the four o&rsquo;clock <i>diligence</i>, but
the urgency aroused the broker&rsquo;s suspicion, and led him to
request Germaine&rsquo;s return in half an hour, which he required to
collect the specie.</p>

<p>The incautious forger went off to his hotel with the promise
in his ear, while the wary broker dropped in on the drawers of
the draft to compare notes. The result of the interview was a
visit to the <i>bureau de police</i>, whence a couple of officers were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg&nbsp;303]</a></span>
despatched to Germaine&rsquo;s hotel. They entered the dandy&rsquo;s room
in disguise, but they were not quick enough to save from destruction
several <i>proof impressions</i> of blank drafts, which the counterfeiter
cast into the fire the moment he heard a knock at his
door. In his trunks, they found engraving tools, a small press,
various acids and a variety of inks; all of which were duly noted
and preserved, while Monsieur Germaine was committed to the
<i>chateau</i>.</p>

<p>In those days there were no electric wires, and as the weather
became thick and cloudy, the old-fashioned semaphore or
telegraph was useless in giving notice to the Parisian police to
stop the payment of a suspected draft, and arrest the forger&rsquo;s
accomplice in the capital.</p>

<p>Soon after the mail <i>of that day</i> from Brest reached the
metropolis, a lady of most respectable appearance, clad in mourning,
presented herself at the counter of the broker&rsquo;s Parisian
correspondent, and exhibiting an unquestionable draft, drew
seventeen thousand francs. From the rapidity with which the
whole of this adroit scheme was accomplished in Brest and Paris,
it seems that Germaine required but four hours to copy, engrave,
print and fill up the forged bill; and yet, so perfectly did he
succeed, that when the discharged draft came back to Brest,
neither drawers, brokers, nor police could distinguish between the
true one and the false! No one had seen Germaine at work, or
could prove complicity with the lady. The mourning dame
was nowhere to be found in Paris, Brest or Marseilles; so that
when I finally quitted the <i>chateau</i>, the adroit <i>chevalier</i> was still
an inmate, but detained only <i>on suspicion</i>!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg&nbsp;304]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII.</h2>


<p>This charming young soldier of fortune was our room-mate for
nine months, and engaged in several of our enterprises for escape.
But Germaine was more a man of <i>finesse</i> than action, and his imprisonment
was the first mishap of that nature in his felonious
career; so that I cannot say I derived much advantage, either
from his contrivances or suggestions.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I always cultivated a sneaking fondness for the sex, and was,
perhaps, especially devoted to those who <i>might</i> aid me if they
pleased, when I got into difficulties. Into this category, under
existing circumstances, fell that very worthy person, Mademoiselle
Babette, whom I have heretofore rather ungallantly reported
as an &ldquo;antique virgin.&rdquo; It is true that Babette was, perhaps,
not as young as she had been; but an unmarried Frenchwoman
is unquestionably possessed of an elixir against age,&mdash;some
<i>eau restoratif</i>,&mdash;with which she defies time, preserves her outlines,
and keeps up that elastic gayety of heart, which renders
her always the most delightful of companions. Now, I do not
pretend, when I flirted with Babette, and sometimes made
downright love to the damsel, that I ever intended leading her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg&nbsp;305]</a></span>
to any of the altars of Brest, when it should please the &ldquo;king of
the barricades&rdquo; to release me from prison. No such design ever
possessed my mind, at the age of twenty-seven, towards a maid
of thirty. Yet, I confess that Babette bewitched the sting and
memory from many an hour of prison-life, and played the comedy
of love <i>&agrave; la Francaise</i> to such perfection, that I doubt not
her heart rebounded from the encounter as scarless as my own.</p>

<p>Germaine joked me very often about the tender passion, the
danger of trifling with youthful hearts, and the risk I ran from
encounters with such glittering eyes; till, one day, he suggested
that we should take advantage of the flirtation, by turning it to
our benefit in flight. Sorret and his wife often went out in the
afternoon, and left the gate and the keys solely in charge of
Babette, who improved their absence by spending half the time
in our apartment. Now, Germaine proposed that, during one of
these absences, I should, in my capacity as teacher, feign some
excuse to leave our room, and, if I found the lieutenant porteress
unwilling to yield the keys to my passionate entreaty, we
would unhesitatingly seize, gag, and muffle the damsel so securely,
that, with the keys in our possession, we might open the gates,
and pass without question the only sentinels who guarded the
exterior corridor. Germaine was eloquent upon the merit of his
scheme, while, to my mind, it indicated the bungling project of a
beginner, and was promptly rejected, because I would not injure
with violence the innocent girl I had trifled with, and because I
would not dishonor the kindness of Sorret and his wife, by compromising
their <i>personal</i> vigilance.</p>

<p>Next morning, Germaine turned over to me long before daylight,
and whispered his delight that I had discarded his scheme,
for it &ldquo;never could have been perfected without passports to
quit the town!&rdquo; This deficiency, he said, had absorbed his
mind the livelong night, and, at last, a bright thought suggested
the supply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Babette,&rdquo; continued the forger, &ldquo;is <i>not</i> to be molested in
any way, so you may make your mind easy about your sweetheart,
though I am afraid she will not be able to accompany us
in our enterprise. First and foremost, we must have a visit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg&nbsp;306]</a></span>
from our Spanish girls to-morrow, and, as you enjoy more influence
than I, it will be best for you to prepare them. Dolores,
who is by far the cleverest of the party, is to go with Concha
boldly to the prefecture of police, and demand passports for
Paris. These, in all likelihood, will be furnished without question.
The passports once in hand, our <i>demoiselles</i> must be off
to an apothecary&rsquo;s for such acids as I shall prescribe; and then,
<i>mon capitaine</i>, leave the rest to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I turned the matter over in my mind, pretending to finish a
morning nap, and, while we were dressing, assented. The Spanish
women, who never refused their countrymen a favor, daringly
obtained the passports, and smuggled them into prison with the
required acids. Before night the deed was done; the gender
of the documents was changed; Germaine was metamorphosed
into &ldquo;<i>Pietro Nazzolini</i>&rdquo; a tailor, and I was turned into a certain
&ldquo;<i>Dominico Antonetti</i>,&rdquo; by trade a carpenter!</p>

<p>How to escape was our next concern. This could not be
effected without breaking prison,&mdash;a task of some enterprise, as
our apartment was above a store-room, always closed, barred, and
locked. The door of our room opened on a long passage, broken
at intervals by several iron gates before the main portal was
reached; so that our only hope was the single window, that illuminated
our apartment and looked into a small yard, guarded
after sunset by a sentinel. This court, moreover, was entirely
hemmed in by a wall, which, if successfully escaladed, would
lead us to the parade ground of the <i>chateau</i>.</p>

<p>Days passed, while my dull brain and the kindled fancy of
the new Nazzolini were inventing plans. Pietro had schemes
enough, for his imagination was both vivid and ceaseless; but
whenever he came to reduce them to words, it was always found
that they required a little more &ldquo;<i>polishing</i> in certain links,&rdquo;
which he forthwith retired to perform.</p>

<p>One of our greatest difficulties was, how to deal with my
officers, who had proved so false on the Senegal. We debated
the matter for a long time; but, considering that they were sick
of long confinement and bereft of future comfort without my
labor we resolved to let them partake our flight, though, once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg&nbsp;307]</a></span>
outside the chateau, we would abandon them to their own
resources.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we imparted our scheme, which was eagerly
embraced; and, through the kindness of our Spanish girls, we
secretly despatched all our spare garments, so that we might not
issue bare into the censorious world.</p>

<p>All being prepared, it was proposed by <i>Signore Pietro</i> that
New Year, which was at hand, should be signalized by our enterprise.
As I had carefully kept and secreted the saw received
from my Goree friends, we possessed a most valuable implement;
so that it was resolved to attack a bar the moment we had been
mustered and locked up on that auspicious night. At eleven, a
descent into the court beneath the window was to be commenced,
and, if this proved successful, there was no doubt we could reach
the beach across the parade. But the sentinel still required
&ldquo;polishing&rdquo; out of the court-yard! This was a tremendous
obstacle; still, Germaine once more put on his fancy-wings, and
recommended that our fair Catalans, whose occupation made
them familiar with the whole regiment, should ascertain the sentinels
for the night in question, and, as it was a festival, they
might easily insinuate a few bottles of brandy into the guard-house,
and prepare the soldiery for sleep instead of vigilance.
But the success and merit of this plan were considered so doubtful,
that another scheme was kept in reserve to silence the soldier
whose duty required a continual march beneath our window.
If the women failed to accomplish our wishes with liquor, and if
the sentry persisted in a vigilant promenade, it was proposed, as
soon as the bar parted, to drop the noose of a <i>lazo</i> quietly over
his head, and dragging him with a run to the window-sill, knock
out his brains, if necessary, with the iron.</p>

<p>The last days of December were at hand; every body was
busy with hope or preparation; the women carried off our garments;
then they brought us an abundance of fishing lines,
hidden beneath their petticoats; and, finally, a rope, strong
enough to hang a man, was spun in darkness by the whole
detachment.</p>

<p>The wished-for day at length came, with the jollity, merriment,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg&nbsp;308]</a></span>
and drunkenness, that attend it almost universally throughout
<i>la belle France</i>. But there was not so sober a party in the
kingdom as that which was anxiously gathered together over a
wineless meal in the chateau of Brest. We trembled lest a
word, a traitor, or an accident, should frustrate our hope of life
and freedom.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, our Spanish women, gay with fresh apparel,
dashing ribbons, and abundant claret, visited their fluttering
birds in the cage, and <i>assured</i> success. The sergeant of the
guard was married to one of their intimate friends, and, <i>in her</i>
company, they were confident, on such a night, of reaching the
guard-room. A long embrace, perhaps a kiss, and a most affectionate
farewell!</p>

<p>Supper was over. Muster passed. Oh! how slowly was
drawn the curtain of darkness over that shortest of days. Would
night <i>never</i> come? It did. By eight o&rsquo;clock the severed bar
hung by threads, while the well-greased <i>lazo</i> lay coiled on the
sill. Nine o&rsquo;clock brought the sentinel, who began his customary
tramp with great regularity, but broke forth in a drinking song
as soon as the sergeant was out of hearing.</p>

<p>So impatient were my comrades for escape, that they declined
waiting till the appointed hour of eleven, and, at ten, ranged
themselves along the floor, with the end of the rope firmly
grasped, ready for a strong and sudden pull, while the intrepid
Germaine stood by, bar in hand, ready to strike, if necessary.
At a signal from me, after I had dropped the <i>lazo</i>, they were to
haul up, make fast, and follow us through the aperture by a
longer rope, which was already fastened for our descent.</p>

<p>Softly the sash was opened, and, stretching my neck into the
darkness, I distinctly saw, by a bright star-light, the form of the
sentinel, pacing, with staggering strides, beneath the casement.
Presently, he came to a dead halt, at the termination of a <i>roulade</i>
in his song, and, in a wink, the <i>lazo</i> was over him. A kick with
my heel served for signal to the halliards, and up flew the pendant
against the window-sill. But, alas! it was not the sentinel.
The noose had not slipped or caught with sufficient rapidity, and
escaping the soldier&rsquo;s neck, it only grasped and secured his <i>chako</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg&nbsp;309]</a></span>
and musket. In an instant, I saw the fatal misfortune, and,
clearing the weapon, dropped it, <i>plumb</i>, on the head of the tipsy
and terrified guardsman. Its fall must have stunned and prostrated
the poor fellow, for not a word or groan escaped from the
court-yard.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg&nbsp;310]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIX.</h2>


<p>Silent as was the sentinel after the restoration of his musket, it
was, nevertheless, unanimously voted that our enterprise was a
failure. Accordingly, the bar was replaced, the window closed,
our implements stowed in the mattresses, and ourselves packed
beneath the blankets, in momentary expectation of a visit from
the jailer and military commander. We passed the night in
feverish expectation, but our bolts remained undrawn.</p>

<p>Bright and early, with a plenteous breakfast, appeared our
spirited Spaniards, and, as the turnkey admitted and locked them
in, they burst into a fit of uproarious laughter at our maladroit
adventure. The poor sentinel, they said, was found, at the end
of his watch, stretched on the ground in a sort of fainting fit
and half frozen. He swore, in accounting for a bleeding skull,
that an invisible hand from the store-room beneath us, had dealt
him a blow that felled him to the earth! His story was so silly
and maudlin, that the captain of the guard, who remembered the
festival and knew the tipsiness of the entire watch, gave no heed
to the tale, but charged it to the account of New Year and
<i>eau de vie</i>. We were sadly jeered by the lasses for our want of
pluck, in forsaking the advantage fortune had thrown in our way,
and I was specially charged to practise my hand more carefully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg&nbsp;311]</a></span>
with the <i>lazo</i>, when I next got a chance on the plantations of
Cuba, or among the <i>vaqueros</i> of Mexico.</p>

<p>As we expected the daily visit from the punctual inspector,
to try our bars with his iron rod, we hastened to secure our window,
and stuffing all the fissures with straw and rags, so as almost
to exclude light, we complained bitterly to the official of the cold
wind to which the apertures exposed us, and thus prevented him
from touching the sash. Besides this precaution, we thought it
best to get rid of our tools and cord in the same way we received
them; and thus terminated our project of escape.</p>

<p>Soon after, I heard from a relative in Paris, that my petition
had been presented to Louis Philippe, whose reception of it encouraged
a hope for my pardon. The news somewhat restored
us to the good humor that used to prevail in our party, but
which had been sadly dashed since our failure. Even Monsieur
Germaine, saw in our anticipated liberation, a phantom of
encouragement for himself, and began to talk confidentially of
his plans. He fancied that I had been gradually schooled <i>into
a taste for misdemeanor</i>, so that he favored me with innumerable
anecdotes of swindling, and countless schemes of future robbery.
By making me an incipient accomplice, he thought to secure my
aid either for his escape or release.</p>

<p>I will take the liberty to record a single specimen of Germaine&rsquo;s
prolific fancy in regard to the higher grades of elegant
felony, and will leave him to the tender mercy of the French
government, which allows no <i>bail</i> for such <i>chevaliers</i> but chastises
their crime with an iron hand.</p>

<p>We had scarcely recovered from our trepidation, when the
forger got up one morning, with a radiant face, and whispered
that the past night was fruitful to his brain, for he had planned
an enterprise which would yield a fortune for <i>any two</i> who were
wise and bold enough to undertake it.</p>

<p>Germaine was a philosophic felon. It was perhaps the trick
of an intellect naturally astute, and of a spirit originally refined,
to reject the vulgar baseness of common pilfering. Germaine
never stole or defrauded;&mdash;he only outwitted and outgeneralled.
If he spoke of the world, either in politics or trade, he insisted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg&nbsp;312]</a></span>
that shams, forgeries, and counterfeits were quite as much played
off in the language, address and dealings of statesmen, merchants,
parsons, doctors, and lawyers, as they were by himself and his
accomplices. The only difference between the felon and the
jury, he alleged, existed in the fact that the jury was in the
majority and the felon in the vocative. He advocated the worst
forms of liberty and equality; he was decidedly in favor of a
division of property, which he was sure would end what <i>the law
called</i> crime, because all would be supplied on the basis of a
common balance. Whenever he told his ancient exploits or suggested
new ones, he glossed them invariably with a rhetorical
varnish about the laws of nature, social contracts, human rights,
<i>meum and tuum</i>; and concluded, to his perfect satisfaction,
with a favorite axiom, that &ldquo;he had quite as much <i>right</i> to the
world&rsquo;s goods as they who possessed them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A hypocritical farrago of this character always prefaced one
of Germaine&rsquo;s tales, so that I hardly ever interrupted the rogue
when he became fluent about social theories, but waited patiently,
in confidence that I was shortly to be entertained with
an adventure or enterprise.</p>

<p>The forger began his story on this occasion with a most fantastical
and exaggerated account of the celebrated <i>Santissima
Casa</i> of Loretto, which he imagined was still endowed with all
the treasures it possessed anterior to its losses during the pontificate
of Pius VI. He asserted that it was the richest tabernacle
in Europe, and that the adornments of the altar were valued at
several millions of crowns,&mdash;the votive offerings and legacies of
devotees during a long period of time.</p>

<p>This holy and opulent shrine, the professor of politico-economico-equality
proposed to rob at some convenient period; and,
to effect it, he had &ldquo;polished&rdquo; the following plan during the
watches of the night.</p>

<p>On some stormy day of winter, he proposed to leave Ancona,
as a traveller from South America, and approaching the convent
attached to the church of the Madonna of Loretto, demand hospitality
for a penitent who had made the tiresome pilgrimage on
a vow to the Virgin. There could be no doubt of his admission.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg&nbsp;313]</a></span>
For three days he would most devoutly attend <i>matins</i> and vespers,
and crave permission to serve as an <i>acolyte</i> at the altar, the
duties of which he perfectly understood. When the period of
his departure arrived, he would be seized with sudden illness,
and, in all likelihood, the brethren would lodge him in their infirmary.
As his malady increased, he would call a confessor,
and, pouring into the father&rsquo;s credulous ear a tale of woes, sorrows,
superstition and humbug, he would make the convent a
donation of <i>all his estates in South America</i>, and pray for a
remission of his sins!</p>

<p>When this comedy was over, convalescence should supervene;
but he would adhere with conscientious obstinacy to his dying
gift, and produce documents showing the immense value of the
bequeathed property. Presently, he would be suddenly smitten
with a love for monastic life; and, on his knees, the Prior was to
be interceded for admission to the brotherhood. All this, probably,
would require time, as well as playacting of the adroitest
character; yet he felt confident he could perform the drama.</p>

<p>At last, when a vow had sealed his novitiate, no one of
the fraternity should exceed him in fervent piety and bodily
mortification. Every hour would find him at the altar before
the Virgin, missal in hand, <i>and eyes intent on the glittering
image</i>. This incessant and unwatched devotion, he calculated,
would enable him in two months to take an impression of all the
locks in the <i>sacristy</i>; and, as his confederate would call every
market-day at the convent gate, in the guise of a pedler, he could
easily cause the keys to be fabricated in different villages by
common locksmiths.</p>

<p>Germaine considered it indispensable that his colleague in
this enterprise should be <i>a sailor</i>; for the flight with booty was
to be made over sea from Ancona. As soon, therefore, as the
keys were perfected, and in the hands of the impostor, the
mariner was to cause a <i>felucca</i>, to cruise off shore, in readiness
for immediate departure. Then, at a fixed time, the pedler
should lurk near the convent, with a couple of mules; and, in
the dead of night, the sacrilege would be accomplished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg&nbsp;314]</a></span>
When he finished his story, the pleasant villain, rubbed his
hands with glee, and skipping about the floor like a dancing-master,
began to whistle &ldquo;<i>La Marsellaise</i>.&rdquo; That night, he
retired earlier than usual, &ldquo;to polish,&rdquo; as he said; but before
dawn he again aroused me, with a pull, and whispered a sudden
fear that his &ldquo;Loretto masterpiece&rdquo; would prove an abortion!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have considered,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that the Virgin&rsquo;s jewels are
probably nothing but false stones and waxen pearls in pinchbeck
gold! Surely, those cunning monks would never leave such an
amount of property idle, simply to adorn a picture or statue!
No, I am positive they must have sold the gems, substituted
imitations, and bought property for their opulent convents!&rdquo;&mdash;As
I felt convinced of this fact, and had some inkling of a recollection
about losses during a former reign, I was happy to hear
that the swindler&rsquo;s fancy had &ldquo;polished&rdquo; the crime to absolute
annihilation.</p>

<p>And now that I am about to leave this forging philosopher
in prison, to mature, doubtless, some greater act of villany, I
will merely add, that when I departed, he was constructing a
new scheme, in which the Emperor of Russia was to be victim
and paymaster. As my liberation occurred before the
finishing touches were given by the artist, I am unable to say
how it fared with Nicholas; but I doubt, exceedingly, whether
the galleys of Brest contained a greater scoundrel, both in deeds
and imaginings, than the metaphysical dandy&mdash;Monsieur Germaine.<a name="FNanchor_7_12" id="FNanchor_7_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_12" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>At length, my pardon and freedom came; but this was the
sole reparation I received at the hands of Louis Philippe, for
the unjust seizure and appropriation of my vessel in the neutral
waters of Africa. When Sorret rushed in, followed by his wife,
Babette, and the children, to announce the glorious news, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg&nbsp;315]</a></span>
good fellow&rsquo;s emotion was so great, that he stood staring at me
like a booby, and for a long while could not articulate. Then
came La Vivandi&egrave;re Dolores, and my pretty Concha. Next
arrived Monsieur Randanne, with the rest of my pupils; so that,
in an hour, I was overwhelmed with sunshine and tears. I can
still feel the grasp of Sorret&rsquo;s hand, as he led me beyond the
bolts and bars, to read the act of royal grace. May we not feel
a <i>spasm</i> of regret at leaving even a prison?</p>

<p>Next day, an affectionate crowd of friends and pupils followed
the emancipated slaver to a vessel, which, by order of the king,
was to bear me, a willing exile, from France for ever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER L.</h2>


<p>I said, at the end of the last chapter, that my friends bade adieu
on the quay of Brest to an &ldquo;emancipated <i>slaver</i>;&rdquo; for <i>slaver</i> I
was determined to continue, notwithstanding the capture of my
vessel, and the tedious incarceration of my body. Had the seizure
and sentence been justly inflicted for a violation of local or international
law, I might, perhaps, have become penitent for early
sins, during the long hours of reflection afforded me in the <i>chateau</i>.
But, with all the fervor of an ardent and thwarted nature,
I was much more disposed to rebel and revenge myself when
opportunity occurred, than to confess my sins with a lowly and
obedient heart. Indeed, most of my time in prison had been
spent in cursing the court and king, or in reflecting how I should
get back to Africa in the speediest manner, if I was ever lucky
enough to elude the grasp of the model monarch.</p>

<p>The vessel that bore me into perpetual banishment from
France, was bound to Lisbon; but, delaying in Portugal only
long enough to procure a new passport, under an assumed name,
I spat upon Louis Philippe&rsquo;s &ldquo;eternal exile,&rdquo; and took shipping
for his loyal port of Marseilles! Here I found two vessels fitting
for the coast of Africa; but, in consequence of the frightful
prevalence of cholera, all mercantile adventures were temporarily
suspended. In fact, such was the panic, that no one dreamed
of despatching the vessel in which I was promised a passage,
until the pestilence subsided. Till this occurred, as my means
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg&nbsp;317]</a></span>
were of the scantiest character, I took lodgings in an humble
hotel.</p>

<p>The dreadful malady was then apparently at its height, and
nearly all the hotels were deserted, for most of the regular inhabitants
had fled; while the city was unfrequented by strangers
except under pressing duty. It is altogether probable that the
lodging-houses and hotels would have been closed entirely, so
slight was their patronage, had not the prefect issued an order,
depriving of their licenses, for the space of two years, all who shut
their doors on strangers. Accordingly, even when the scourge
swept many hundred victims daily to their graves, every hotel,
caf&eacute;, grocery, butcher shop, and bakery, was regularly opened in
Marseilles; so that a dread of famine was not added to the fear
of cholera.</p>

<p>Of course, the lowly establishment where I dwelt was not
thronged at this epoch; most of its inmates or frequenters had
departed for the country before my arrival, and I found the
house tenanted alone by three boarders and a surly landlord, who
cursed the authorities for their compulsory edict. My reception,
therefore, was by no means cordial. I was told that the proclamation
had not prevented the <i>cook</i> from departing; and that I
must be content with whatever the master of the house could toss
up for my fare.</p>

<p>A sailor&mdash;especially one fresh from the <i>chateau</i> of Brest,&mdash;is
not apt to be over nice in the article of cookery, and I readily
accompanied my knight of the rueful countenance to his <i>table
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>, which I found to be a long oval board, three fourths bare
of cloth and guests, while five human visages clustered around
its end.</p>

<p>I took my seat opposite a trim dashing brunette, with the
brightest eyes and rosiest cheeks imaginable. Her face was so
healthily refreshing in the midst of malady and death, that I
altogether forgot the cholera under the charm of her ardent gaze.
Next me sat a comical sort of fellow, who did not delay in scraping
an acquaintance, and jocularly insisted on introducing all the
company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of emergency,&rdquo; said the droll, &ldquo;we have no time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg&nbsp;318]</a></span>
to lose or to stand on the ceremony of fashionable etiquette.
Here to-day, gone to-morrow&mdash;is the motto of Marseilles! <i>Hola!
Messieurs</i>, shall we not make the most of new acquaintances
when they may be so brief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thanked him for his hospitality. I had so little to lose in
this world, either of property or friends, that I feared the cholera
quite as slightly as any of the company. &ldquo;A thousand thanks,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;Monsieur, for your politeness; I&rsquo;ll bury you to-morrow,
if it is the cholera&rsquo;s pleasure, with ten times more pleasure now
that I have had the honor of an introduction. A fashionable
man hardly cares to be civil to a stranger&mdash;even if he happens to
be a corpse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was so hearty a cheer at this sally, that, in spite of the
shallow soundings of my purse, I called for a fresh bottle, and
pledged the party in a bumper all round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; continued my neighbor, &ldquo;as it may be necessary
for some one of us to write your epitaph in a day or two, or, at
least, to send a message of condolence and sympathy to your
friends; pray let us know a bit of your history, and what the devil
brings you to Marseilles when the cholera thermometer is up to
1000 degrees per diem?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Very few words were necessary to impart such a name and
tale as I chose to invent for the company&rsquo;s edification. &ldquo;Santiago
Ximenes,&rdquo; and my tawny skin betokened my nationality and
profession, while my threadbare garments spoke louder than
words that I was at suit with Fortune.</p>

<p>Presently, after a lull in the chat, a dapper little prig of a
dandy, who sat on my left, volunteered to inform me that he was no
less a personage than <i>le Docteur</i> Du Jean, a medical practitioner
fresh from Metropolitan hospitals, who, in a spirit of the loftiest
philanthropy, visited this provincial town at his own expense to
succor the poor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est une belle dame, notre vis &agrave; vis, n&rsquo;est elle pas mon
cher?</i>&rdquo; said he pointing to our patron saint opposite.</p>

<p>I admitted without argument that she was the most charming
woman I ever saw out of Cuba.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est ma ch&egrave;re amie</i>,&rdquo; whispered he confidentially in my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg&nbsp;319]</a></span>
ear, strongly emphasizing the word &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and nodding very
knowingly towards the lady herself. &ldquo;At the present moment
the dear little creature is exclusively under my charge and protection,
for she is <i>en route</i> to join her husband, a captain in the army
at Algiers; but, alas! <i>gr&acirc;ce &agrave; Dieu</i>, there&rsquo;s no chance of a transport
so long as this cursed pestilence blockades Marseilles!
Do you know the man on your right?&mdash;No! <i>Bien!</i> that&rsquo;s
the celebrated S&mdash;&mdash;, the oratorical advocate about whom the
papers rang when Louis Philippe began his assault on the press.
He&rsquo;s on his way to Algiers too, and will be more successful in
liberalizing the Arabs than the French. That old chap over
yonder with the snuffy nose, the snuffy wig, and snuffy coat, is a
grand speculator in horses, on his way to the richest cavalry corps
of the army; and, as for our <i>ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;hotel</i> at the head of this
segment, <i>pauvre diable</i>, you see what he is without a revelation.
The pestilence has nearly used him up. He sits half the day in
his bureau on the stairs looking for guests who never come, reading
the record which adds no name, cursing the cholera, counting a
penitential <i>ave</i> and <i>pater</i> on his rosary, and flying from the despair
of silence and desertion to his pans to stew our wretched fare.
<i>Voila mon cher, la carte de la table! le Cholera et ses Convives!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>If there is a creature I detest in the world it is a flippant,
intrusive, voluntary youth who thrusts his conversation and affairs
upon strangers, and makes bold to monopolize their time with his
unasked confidence. Such persons are always silly and vulgar
pretenders; and before Doctor Du Jean got through his description
of the lady, I had already classified him among my particular
aversions.</p>

<p>When the doctor nodded so patronizingly to the dame, and
spoke of his friendly protectorate, I thought I saw that the
quick-witted woman not only comprehended his intimation, but
denied it by the sudden glance she gave me from beneath her
thin and arching eyebrows. So, when dinner was over, without
saying a word to the doctor, I made a slight inclination of the
head to Madame Duprez, and rising before the other guests,
passed to her side and tendered my arm for a promenade on the
balcony.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg&nbsp;320]</a></span>
&ldquo;<i>Mon docteur</i>,&rdquo; said I as we left the room, &ldquo;life, you know,
is too short and precarious to suffer a monopoly of such blessings,&rdquo;&mdash;looking
intently into the lady&rsquo;s eyes,&mdash;&ldquo;besides which, we
sailors, in defiance of you landsmen, go in for the most &lsquo;perfect
freedom of the seas.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Duprez declared I was entirely right; that I was no
pirate.&mdash;&ldquo;Mais, mon capitaine,&rdquo; said the fair one, as she leaned
with a fond pressure on my arm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have no objection if you were,
so that you&rsquo;d capture me from that frightful gallipot! Besides, you
sailors are always so gallant towards the ladies, and tell us such
delightful stories, and bring us such charming presents when you
come home, and love us so much while you&rsquo;re in port, because
you see so few when you are away! Now isn&rsquo;t that a delightful
<i>catalogue raisonn&eacute;</i> of arguments why women should love <i>les
m&acirc;telots</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pity then, madame,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that you married a <i>soldier</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; returned the ready dame, &ldquo;<i>I</i> didn&rsquo;t;&mdash;that was my
mother&rsquo;s match. In France, you know, the old folks marry us;
but we take the liberty to <i>love</i> whomsoever we please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, what of <i>Monsieur le capitaine</i>, in the present instance?&rdquo;
interrupted I inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! <i>fi donc!</i>&rdquo; said Madame, &ldquo;what bad taste to speak of
an <i>absent</i>, husband when you have the liberty to talk with a
<i>present</i> wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, the lovely Helen of this tavern-Troy was the
dearest of coquettes, whose fence of tongue was as beautiful a
game of thrust and parry as I ever saw played with Parisian foils.
Du Jean had been horribly mortified by the contemptuous manner
in which the threadbare Spaniard bore off his imaginary prize;
and would probably have assailed me on the spot, before he knew
my temper or quality, had not the lawyer drawn him aside on a
plea of medical advice and given his inflamed honor time to cool.</p>

<p>But the wit of Madame Duprez was not so satisfied by a
single specimen of our mutual folly, as to allow the surgeon to
resume the undisputed post of <i>cavaliere serviente</i> which he occupied
before my arrival. It was her delight to see us at loggerheads
for her favor, and though we were both aware of her arrant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg&nbsp;321]</a></span>
coquetry, neither had moral courage enough, in that dismal time,
to desist from offering the most servile courtesies. We mined
and counter-mined, marched and counter-marched, deceived and
re-deceived, for several days, without material advantage to either,
till, at last, the affair ended in a battle.</p>

<p>The prefecture&rsquo;s bulletin announced at dinner-time twelve
hundred deaths! but, in spite of the horror, or perhaps to drown
its memory, our undiminished party called for several more bottles,
and became uproariously gay.</p>

<p>The conversation took a physiological turn; and gradually
the modern science of phrenology, which was just then becoming
fashionable, came on the carpet. Doctor Du Jean professed
familiarity with its mysteries. Spurzheim, he said, had been his
professor in Paris. He could read our characters on our skulls
as if they were written in a book. Powers, passions, propensities,
and even thoughts, could not be hidden from him;&mdash;and,
&ldquo;who dared try his skill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>C&rsquo;est moi!</i>&rdquo; said Madame Duprez, as she drew her chair
to the centre of the room, and accepting the challenge, cast loose
her beautiful hair, which fell in a raven torrent over snowy neck
and shoulders, heightening tenfold every charm of face and
figure.</p>

<p>Du Jean was nothing loth to commence his tender manipulation
of the charming head, whose wicked mouth and teasing eyes
shot glances of defiance at me. Several organs were disclosed
and explained to the company; but then came others which he
ventured to whisper in her ears alone, and, as he did so, I noticed
that his mouth was pressed rather deeper than I thought needful
among the folds of her heavy locks. I took the liberty to hint
rather jestingly that the doctor &ldquo;<i>cut quite too deep</i> with his
lips;&rdquo; but the coquette at once saw my annoyance, and persisted
with malicious delight in making Du Jean whisper&mdash;heaven
knows what&mdash;in her ear. In fact, she insisted that some of the
organs should be repeated to her three or four times over, while,
at each rehearsal, the doctor grew bolder in his dives among the
curls, and the lady louder and redder in her merriment.</p>

<p>At last, propriety required that the scene should be closed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg&nbsp;322]</a></span>
and no one knew better than this arch coquette the precise limit
of decency&rsquo;s bounds. Next came the lawyer&rsquo;s cranium; then
followed the horse-jockey and tavern-keeper; and finally, it was
<i>my</i> turn to take the stool.</p>

<p>I made every objection I could think of against submitting
to inspection, for I was sure the surgeon had wit enough not to
lose so good a chance of quizzing or ridiculing me; but a whispered
word from Madame forced an assent, with the stipulation
that Du Jean should allow <i>me</i> to examine his skull afterwards,
pretending that if he had studied with Spurzheim, I had learned
the science from Gall.</p>

<p>The doctor accepted the terms and began his lecture. First
of all my Jealousy was enormous, and only equalled by my Conceit
and Envy. I was altogether destitute of Love, Friendship,
or the Moral sentiments. I was an immoderate wine-bibber;
extremely avaricious; passionate, revengeful, and blood-thirsty;
in fine, I was a monstrous conglomerate of every thing devilish
and dreadful. The first two or three essays of the doctor amused
the company and brought down a round of laughter; but as he
grew coarser and coarser, I saw the increasing disgust of our
comrades by their silence, though I preserved my temper most
admirably till he was done. Then I rose slowly from the seat,
and pointing the doctor silently to the vacant chair,&mdash;for I could
not speak with rage,&mdash;I took my stand immediately in front of
him, gazing intently into his eyes. The company gathered
eagerly round, expecting I would retaliate wittily, or pay him
back in his coin of abuse.</p>

<p>After a minute&rsquo;s pause I regained my power of speech, and
inquired whether the phrenologist was ready. He replied affirmatively;
whereupon my right hand discovered the bump of impudence
with a tremendous slap on his left cheek, while my left
hand detected the organ of blackguardism with equal prominence
on his right!</p>

<p>It was natural that this new mode of scientific investigation
was as novel and surprising as it was disagreeable to poor Du
Jean; for, in an instant, we were exchanging blows with intense
zeal, and would probably have borrowed a couple of graves from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg&nbsp;323]</a></span>
the cholera, had not the boarders interfered. All hands, however,
were unanimous in my favor, asserting that Du Jean had
provoked me beyond endurance; and, as <i>la belle Duprez</i> joined
heartily in the verdict, the doctor gave up the contest, and, ever
after, &ldquo;cut&rdquo; the lady.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI.</h2>


<p>In the first lull of the pestilence, the French merchantman was
despatched from Marseilles, and, in twenty-seven days, I had the
pleasure to shake hands with the generous friends, who, two
years before, labored so hard for my escape. The colonial government
soon got wind of my presence notwithstanding my disguise,
and warning me from Goree, cut short the joys of an
African welcome.</p>

<p>I reached Sierra Leone in time to witness the arbitrary proceeding
of the British government towards Spanish traders and
coasters, by virtue of the treaty for the suppression of the slave-trade.
<i>Six months</i> after this compact was signed and ratified in
London and Madrid, it was made known with the proverbial despatch
of Spain, in the Islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. Its stipulations
were such as to allow very considerable latitude of judgment
in captures; and when prizes were once within the grasp
of the British lion, that amiable animal was neither prompt to release
nor anxious to acquit. Accordingly, when I reached Sierra
Leone, I beheld at anchor under government guns, some thirty
or forty vessels seized by cruisers, several of which I have reason
to believe were captured in the &ldquo;Middle Passage,&rdquo; bound from
Havana to Spain, but entirely free from the taint or design of
slavery.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg&nbsp;325]</a></span>
I was not so inquisitive or patriotic in regard to treaty rights
and violations, as to dally from mere curiosity in Sierra Leone.
My chief object was employment. At twenty-eight, after trials,
hazards, and chances enough to have won half a dozen fortunes,
I was utterly penniless. The Mongo of Kambia,&mdash;the Mahometan
convert of Ahmah-de-Bellah,&mdash;the pet of the Ali-Mami of Footha-Yallon,&mdash;the
leader of slave caravans,&mdash;the owner of barracoons,&mdash;and
the bold master of clippers that defied the British flag,
was reduced to the humble situation of coast-pilot and interpreter
on board an American brig bound to the celebrated slave
mart of Gallinas! We reached our destination safely; but I
doubt exceedingly whether the &ldquo;Reaper&rsquo;s&rdquo; captain knows to this
day that his brig was guided by a marine adventurer, who knew
nothing of the coast or port save the little he gleaned in half a
dozen chats with a Spaniard, who was familiar with this notorious
resort and its surroundings.</p>

<p>In the history of African servitude, no theatre of Spanish,
Portuguese, British, or American action has been the scene of
more touching, tragic, and <i>profitable</i> incidents than the one to
which fortune had now directed my feet.</p>

<p>Before the generous heart and far-seeing mind of America
perceived <i>in Colonization</i>, the true secret of Africa&rsquo;s hope, the
whole of its coast, from the Rio Gambia to Cape Palmas, without
a break except at Sierra Leone, was the secure haunt of daring
slavers. The first impression on this lawless disposal of full
fifteen hundred miles of beach and continent, was made by the
bold establishment of Liberia; and, little by little has its power
extended, until treaty, purchase, negotiation, and influence, drove
the trade from the entire region. After the firm establishment
of this colony, the slave-trade on the windward coast, north and
west of Cape Palmas, was mainly confined to Portuguese settlements
at Bissaos, on the Rios Grande, Nunez, and Pongo, at
Grand and Little Bassa, New Sestros and Trade-town; but the
lordly establishment at Gallinas was the heart of the slave marts,
to which, in fact, Cape Mesurado was only second in importance.</p>

<p>Our concern is now with Gallinas. Nearly one hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg&nbsp;326]</a></span>
miles north-west of Monrovia, a short and sluggish river, hearing
this well-known name, oozes lazily into the Atlantic; and, carrying
down in the rainy season a rich alluvion from the interior,
sinks the deposit where the tide meets the Atlantic, and forms
an interminable mesh of spongy islands. To one who approaches
from sea, they loom up from its surface, covered with reeds and
mangroves, like an immense field of <i>fungi</i>, betokening the damp
and dismal field which death and slavery have selected for their
grand metropolis. A spot like this, possessed, of course, no peculiar
advantages for agriculture or commerce; but its dangerous
bar, and its extreme desolation, fitted it for the haunt of the outlaw
and slaver.</p>

<p>Such, in all likelihood, were the reasons that induced Don
Pedro Blanco, a well-educated mariner from Malaga, to select
Gallinas as the field of his operations. Don Pedro visited this
place originally in command of a slaver; but failing to complete
his cargo, sent his vessel back with one hundred negroes, whose
value was barely sufficient to pay the mates and crew. Blanco,
however, remained on the coast with a portion of the Conquistador&rsquo;s
cargo, and, on its basis, began a trade with the natives and
slaver-captains, till, four years after, he remitted his owners the
product of their merchandise, and began to flourish on his own
account. The honest return of an investment long given over as
lost, was perhaps the most active stimulant of his success, and
for many years he monopolized the traffic of the Vey country,
reaping enormous profits from his enterprise.</p>

<p>Gallinas was not in its prime when I came thither, yet enough
of its ancient power and influence remained to show the comprehensive
mind of Pedro Blanco. As I entered the river, and
wound along through the labyrinth of islands, I was struck, first
of all, with the vigilance that made this Spaniard stud the field
with look-out seats, protected from sun and rain, erected some
seventy-five or hundred feet above the ground, either on poles or
on isolated trees, from which the horizon was constantly swept
by telescopes, to announce the approach of cruisers or slavers.
These telegraphic operators were the keenest men on the islands,
who were never at fault, in discriminating between friend and foe.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg&nbsp;327]</a></span>
About a mile from the river&rsquo;s mouth we found a group of islets,
on each of which was erected the factory of some particular slave-merchant
belonging to the grand confederacy. Blanco&rsquo;s establishments
were on several of these marshy flats. On one, near
the mouth, he had his place of business or trade with foreign vessels,
presided over by his principal clerk, an astute and clever
gentleman. On another island, more remote, was his residence,
where the only white person was a sister, who, for a while, shared
with Don Pedro his solitary and penitential domain. Here this
man of education and refined address surrounded himself with
every luxury that could be purchased in Europe or the Indies,
and dwelt in a sort of oriental but semi-barbarous splendor, that
suited an African prince rather than a Spanish grandee. Further
inland was another islet, devoted to his seraglio, within
whose recesses each of his favorites inhabited her separate establishment,
after the fashion of the natives. Independent of all
these were other islands, devoted to the barracoons or slave-prisons,
ten or twelve of which contained from one hundred to five
hundred slaves in each. These barracoons were made of rough
staves or poles of the hardest trees, four or six inches in diameter,
driven five feet in the ground, and clamped together by
double rows of iron bars. Their roofs were constructed of similar
wood, strongly secured, and overlaid with a thick thatch of
long and wiry grass, rendering the interior both dry and cool.
At the ends, watch-houses&mdash;built near the entrance&mdash;were tenanted
by sentinels, with loaded muskets. Each barracoon was
tended by two or four Spaniards or Portuguese; but I have
rarely met a more wretched class of human beings, upon whom
fever and dropsy seemed to have emptied their vials.</p>

<p>Such were the surroundings of Don Pedro in 1836, when I
first saw his slender figure, swarthy face, and received the graceful
welcome, which I hardly expected from one who had passed fifteen
years without crossing the bar of Gallinas! Three years
after this interview, he left the coast for ever, with a fortune of
near a million. For a while, he dwelt in Havana, engaged in
commerce; but I understood that family difficulties induced him
to retire altogether from trade; so that, if still alive, he is probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg&nbsp;328]</a></span>
a resident of &ldquo;Geneva la Superba,&rdquo; whither he went from
the island of Cuba.</p>

<p>The power of this man among the natives is well-known; it
far exceeded that of Cha-cha, of whom I have already spoken.
Resolved as he was to be successful in traffic, he left no means
untried, with blacks as well as whites, to secure prosperity. I
have often been asked what was the character of a mind which
could voluntarily isolate itself for near a lifetime amid the pestilential
swamps of a burning climate, trafficking in human flesh,
exciting wars, bribing and corrupting ignorant negroes; totally
without society, amusement, excitement, or change; living, from
year to year, the same dull round of seasons and faces; without
companionship, save that of men at war with law; cut loose from
all ties except those which avarice formed among European outcasts
who were willing to become satellites to such a luminary
as Don Pedro? I have always replied to the question, that this
African enigma puzzled <i>me</i> as well as those orderly and systematic
persons, who would naturally be more shocked at the
tastes and prolonged career of a resident slave-factor in the
marshes of Gallinas.</p>

<p>I heard many tales on the coast of Blanco&rsquo;s cruelty, but I
doubt them quite as much as I do the stories of his pride and
arrogance. I have heard it said that he shot a sailor for daring
to ask him for permission to light his cigar at the <i>puro</i> of the
Don. Upon another occasion, it is said that he was travelling
the beach some distance from Gallinas, near the island of Sherbro,
where he was unknown, when he approached a native hut for
rest and refreshment. The owner was squatted at the door, and,
on being requested by Don Pedro to hand him fire to light his
cigar, deliberately refused. In an instant Blanco drew back,
seized a carabine from one of his attendants, and slew the negro
on the spot. It is true that the narrator apologized for Don
Pedro, by saying, that to deny a Castilian <i>fire for his tobacco</i> was
the gravest insult that can be offered him; yet, from my knowledge
of the person in question, I cannot believe that he carried
etiquette to so frightful a pitch, even among a class whose lives
are considered of trifling value <i>except in market</i>. On several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg&nbsp;329]</a></span>
occasions, during our subsequent intimacy, I knew him to chastise
with rods, even to the brink of death, servants who ventured
to infringe the sacred limits of his <i>seraglio</i>. But, on the other
hand, his generosity was proverbially ostentatious, not only
among the natives, whom it was his interest to suborn, but
to the whites who were in his employ, or needed his kindly
succor. I have already alluded to his mental culture, which was
decidedly <i>soign&eacute;</i> for a Spaniard of his original grade and time.
His memory was remarkable. I remember one night, while several
of his <i>employ&eacute;s</i> were striving unsuccessfully to repeat the
Lord&rsquo;s prayer in Latin, upon which they had made a bet, that
Don Pedro joined the party, and taking up the wager, went
through the petition without faltering. It was, indeed, a sad
parody on prayer to hear its blessed accents fall perfectly from
such lips on a bet; but when it was won, the slaver insisted on
receiving <i>the slave which was the stake</i>, and immediately bestowed
him in charity on a captain, who had fallen into the
clutches of a British cruiser!</p>

<p>Such is a rude sketch of the great man merchant of Africa,
the Rothschild of slavery, whose bills on England, France, or the
United States, were as good as gold in Sierra Leone and Monrovia!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LII.</h2>


<p>The day after our arrival within the realm of this great spider,&mdash;who,
throned in the centre of his mesh, was able to catch almost
every fly that flew athwart the web,&mdash;I landed at one of the
minor factories, and sold a thousand quarter-kegs of powder to
Don Jos&eacute; Ramon. But, next day, when I proceeded in my capacity
of interpreter to the establishment of Don Pedro, I found
his Castilian plumage ruffled, and, though we were received with
formal politeness, he declined to purchase, because we had failed
to address <i>him</i> in advance of any other factor on the river.</p>

<p>The folks at Sierra Leone dwelt so tenderly on the generous
side of Blanco&rsquo;s character, that I was still not without hope that
I might induce him to purchase a good deal of our rum and
tobacco, which would be drugs on our hands unless he consented
to relieve us. I did not think it altogether wrong, therefore, to
concoct a little <i>ruse</i> whereby I hoped to touch the pocket through
the breast of the Don. In fact, I addressed him a note, in which
I truly related my recent mishaps, adventures, and imprisonments;
but I concluded the narrative with a hope that he would
succor one so destitute and unhappy, by allowing him to win an
honest <i>commission</i> allowed by the American captain on any sales
I could effect. The bait took; a prompt, laconic answer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg&nbsp;331]</a></span>
returned; I was bidden to come ashore with the invoice of our
cargo; and, <i>for my sake</i>, Don Pedro purchased from the Yankee
brig $5000 worth of rum and tobacco, all of which was paid by
drafts on London, <i>of which slaves were, of course, the original
basis</i>! My imaginary commissions, however, remained in the
purse of the owners.</p>

<p>An accident occurred in landing our merchandise, which will
serve to illustrate the character of Blanco. While the hogsheads
of tobacco were discharging, our second mate, who suffered
from <i>strabismus</i> more painfully than almost any cross-eyed man
I ever saw, became excessively provoked with one of the native
boatmen who had been employed in the service. It is probable
that the negro was insolent, which the mate thought proper to
chastise by throwing staves at the Krooman&rsquo;s head. The negro
fled, seeking refuge on the other side of his canoe; but the enraged
officer continued the pursuit, and, in his double-sighted
blundering, ran against an oar which the persecuted black suddenly
lifted in self-defence. I know not whether it was rage or
blindness, or both combined, that prevented the American from
seeing the blade, but on he dashed, rushing impetuously against
the implement, severing his lip with a frightful gash, and knocking
four teeth from his upper jaw.</p>

<p>Of course, the luckless negro instantly fled to &ldquo;the bush;&rdquo;
and, that night, in the agony of delirium, caused by fever and
dreaded deformity, the mate terminated his existence by laudanum.</p>

<p>The African law condemns the man who <i>draws blood</i> to a
severe fine in slaves, proportioned to the harm that may have
been inflicted. Accordingly, the culprit Krooman, innocent as
he was of premeditated evil, now lay heavily loaded with irons in
Don Pedro&rsquo;s barracoon, awaiting the sentence which the whites
in his service already declared <i>should be death</i>. &ldquo;He struck a
white!&rdquo; they said, and the wound he inflicted was reported to
have caused that white man&rsquo;s ruin. But, luckily, before the sentence
was executed, <i>I</i> came ashore, and, as the transaction occurred
in my presence, I ventured to appeal from the verdict of
public opinion to Don Pedro, with the hope that I might exculpate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg&nbsp;332]</a></span>
the Krooman. My simple and truthful story was sufficient.
An order was instantly given for the black&rsquo;s release, and, in
spite of native chiefs and grumbling whites, who were savagely
greedy for the fellow&rsquo;s blood, Don Pedro persisted in his judgment
and sent him back on board the &ldquo;Reaper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The character manifested by Blanco on this occasion, and
the admirable management of his factory, induced me to seize a
favorable moment to offer my services to the mighty trader.
They were promptly accepted, and in a short time I was employed
as <i>principal</i> in one of Don Pedro&rsquo;s branches.</p>

<p>The Vey natives on this river and its neighborhood were not
numerous before the establishment of Spanish factories, but since
1813, the epoch of the arrival of several Cuban vessels with rich,
merchandise, the neighboring tribes flocked to the swampy flats,
and as there was much similarity in the language and habits of
the natives and emigrants, they soon intermarried and mingled in
ownership of the soil.</p>

<p>In proportion as these upstarts were educated in slave-trade
under the influence of opulent factors, they greedily acquired the
habit of hunting their own kind and abandoned all other occupations
but war and kidnapping. As the country was prolific and
the trade profitable, the thousands and tens of thousands annually
sent abroad from Gallinas, soon began to exhaust the neighborhood;
but the appetite for plunder was neither satiated nor
stopped by distance, when it became necessary for the neighboring
natives to extend their forays and hunts far into the interior.
In a few years war raged wherever the influence of this river extended.
The slave factories supplied the huntsmen with powder,
weapons, and enticing merchandise, so that they fearlessly advanced
against ignorant multitudes, who, too silly to comprehend
the benefit of alliance, fought the aggressors singly, and,
of course, became their prey.</p>

<p>Still, however, the demand increased. Don Pedro and his
satellites had struck a vein richer than the gold coast. His
flush barracoons became proverbial throughout the Spanish and
Portuguese colonies, and his look-outs were ceaseless in their
signals of approaching vessels. New factories were established,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg&nbsp;333]</a></span>
as branches, north and south of the parent den. Mana Rock,
Sherbro, Sugarei, Cape Mount, Little Cape Mount, and even
Digby, at the door of Monrovia, all had depots and barracoons
of slaves belonging to the whites of Gallinas.</p>

<p>But this prosperity did not endure. The torch of discord, in
a civil war which was designed for revengeful murder rather than
slavery, was kindled by a black Paris, who had deprived his uncle
of an Ethiopian Helen. Every bush and hamlet contained
its Achilles and Ulysses, and every town rose to the dignity of
a Troy.</p>

<p>The geographical configuration of the country, as I have described
it, isolated almost every family of note on various branches
of the river, so that nearly all were enabled to fortify themselves
within their islands or marshy flats. The principal parties in this
family feud were the Amarars and Shiakars. Amarar was a
native of Shebar, and, through several generations, had Mandingo
blood in his veins;&mdash;Shiakar, born on the river, considered
himself a noble of the land, and being aggressor in this conflict,
disputed his prize with the wildest ferocity of a savage.
The whites, who are ever on the watch for native quarrels,
wisely refrained from partisanship with either of the combatants,
but continued to purchase the prisoners brought
to their factories by both parties. Many a vessel bore across the
Atlantic two inveterate enemies shackled to the same bolt, while
others met on the same deck a long-lost child or brother who
had been captured in the civil war.</p>

<p>I might fill a volume with the narrative of this horrid conflict
before it was terminated by the death of Amarar. For several
months this savage had been blockaded in his stockade by
Shiakar&rsquo;s warriors. At length a sortie became indispensable to
obtain provisions, but the enemy were too numerous to justify
the risk. Upon this, Amarar called his soothsayer, and required
him to name a propitious moment for the sally. The oracle
retired to his den, and, after suitable incantations, declared that
the effort should be made as soon as the hands of Amarar were
stained in the blood of his own son. It is said that the prophet intended
the victim to be a youthful son of Amarar, who had joined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg&nbsp;334]</a></span>
his mother&rsquo;s family, and was then distant; but the impatient
and superstitious savage, seeing a child of his own, two years
old, at hand, when the oracle announced the decree, snatched the
infant from his mother&rsquo;s arms, threw it into a rice mortar, and,
with a pestle, mashed it to death!</p>

<p>The sacrifice over, a sortie was ordered. The infuriate and
starving savages, roused by the oracle and inflamed by the
bloody scene, rushed forth tumultuously. Amarar, armed with
the pestle, still warm and reeking with his infant&rsquo;s blood, was
foremost in the onset. The besiegers gave way and fled; the
town was re-provisioned; the fortifications of the enemy demolished,
and the soothsayer rewarded with a slave for his barbarous
prediction!</p>

<p>At another time, Amarar was on the point of attacking a
strongly fortified town, when doubts were intimated of success.
Again the wizard was consulted, when the mysterious oracle
declared that the chief &ldquo;<i>could not conquer till he returned once
more to his mother&rsquo;s womb</i>!&rdquo; That night Amarar committed
the blackest of incests; but his party was repulsed, and the false
prophet stoned to death!</p>

<p>These are faint incidents of a savage drama which lasted several
years, until Amarar, in his native town, became the prisoner
of Shiakar&rsquo;s soldiery. Mana, his captor, caused him to be decapitated;
and while the blood still streamed from the severed
neck, the monster&rsquo;s head was thrust into the fresh-torn bowels
of his mother!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg&nbsp;335]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIII.</h2>


<p>The first expedition upon which Don Pedro Blanco despatched
me revealed a new phase of Africa to my astonished eyes. I was
sent in a small Portuguese schooner to Liberia for tobacco; and
here the trader who had never contemplated the negro on the
shores of his parent country except as a slave or a catcher of
slaves, first beheld the rudiments of an infant state, which in
time may become the wedge of Ethiopian civilization. The comfortable
government house, neat public warerooms, large emigration
home, designed for the accommodation of the houseless;
clean and spacious streets, with brick stores and dwellings; the
twin churches with their bells and comfortable surroundings; the
genial welcome from well dressed negroes; the regular wharves
and trim craft on the stocks, and last of all, a visit from a colored
collector with a <i>printed</i> bill for twelve dollars &ldquo;anchor dues,&rdquo;
all convinced me that there was, in truth, something more in these
ebony frames than an article of commerce and labor. I paid the
bill eagerly,&mdash;considering that a document <i>printed in Africa by
Negroes</i>, under North American influence, would be a curiosity
among the infidels of Gallinas!</p>

<p>My engagements with Blanco had been made on the basis
of familiarity with the slave-trade in all its branches, but my
independent spirit and impatient temper forbade, from the first,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg&nbsp;336]</a></span>
the acceptance of any subordinate position at Gallinas. Accordingly,
as soon as I returned from the new Republic, Don Pedro
desired me to prepare for the establishment of a branch factory,
under my exclusive control, at New Sestros, an independent
principality in the hands of a Bassa chief.</p>

<p>I lost no time in setting forth on this career of comparative
independence, and landed with the trading cargo provided for
me, at the Kroomen&rsquo;s town, where I thought it best to dwell till
a factory could be built.</p>

<p>An African, as well as a white man, must be drilled into the
traffic. It is one of those things that do not &ldquo;come by nature:&rdquo;
yet its mysteries are acquired, like the mysteries of commerce
generally, with much more facility by some tribes than others.
I found this signally illustrated by the prince and people of New
Sestros, and very soon detected their great inferiority to the
Soosoos, Mandingoes, and Veys. For a time their conduct was
so silly, arrogant, and trifling, that I closed my chests and broke
off communication. Besides this, the slaves they offered were
of an inferior character and held at exorbitant prices. Still, as
I was commanded to purchase rapidly, I managed to collect
about seventy-five negroes of medium grades, all of whom I designed
sending to Gallinas in the schooner that was tugging at
her anchor off the beach.</p>

<p>At the proper time I sent for the black prince <i>to assist me in
shipping the slaves</i>, and to receive the head-money which was
his export duty on my cargo. The answer to my message was an
illustration of the character and insolence of the ragamuffins with
whom I had to deal. &ldquo;The prince,&rdquo; returned my messenger,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t like your sauciness, Don T&eacute;odore, <i>and won&rsquo;t come till
you beg his pardon by a present</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is very true that after my visit to their republic, I began
to entertain a greater degree of respect than was my wont, for
black men, yet my contempt for the original, unmodified race was
so great, that when the prince&rsquo;s son, a boy of sixteen, delivered
this reply on behalf of his father, I did not hesitate to cram it
down his throat by a back-handed blow, which sent the sprig of
royalty bleeding and howling home.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg&nbsp;337]</a></span>
It may be easily imagined what was the condition of the native
town when the boy got back to the &ldquo;palace,&rdquo; and told his
tale of Spanish boxing. In less than ten minutes, another messenger
arrived with an order for my departure from the country
&ldquo;before next day at noon;&rdquo;&mdash;an order which, the envoy declared,
would be <i>enforced</i> by the outraged townsfolk unless I willingly
complied.</p>

<p>Now, I had been too long in Africa to tremble before a
negro prince, and though I really hated the region, I determined
to disobey in order to teach the upstart a lesson of civilized manners.
Accordingly, I made suitable preparations for resistance,
and, when my hired servants and <i>barracooniers</i> fled in terror at
the prince&rsquo;s command, I landed some whites from my schooner,
to aid in protecting our slaves.</p>

<p>By this time, my house had been constructed of the frail bamboos
and matting which are exclusively used in the buildings of
the Bassa country. I had added a cane verandah or piazza to
mine, and protected it from the pilfering natives, by a high palisade,
that effectually excluded all intruders. Within the area of
this inclosure was slung my hammock, and here I ate my meals,
read, wrote, and received &ldquo;Princes&rdquo; as well as the mob.</p>

<p>At nightfall, I loaded twenty-five muskets, and placed them
<i>inside my sofa</i>, which was a long trade-chest. I covered the
deal table with a blanket, beneath whose pendent folds I concealed
a keg of powder <i>with the head out</i>. Hard by, under a broad-brimmed
<i>sombrero</i>, lay a pair of double-barrelled pistols. With
these dispositions of my volcanic armory, I swung myself asleep
in the hammock, and leaving the three whites to take turns in
watching, never stirred till an hour after sunrise, when I was
roused by the war-drum and bells from the village, announcing
the prince&rsquo;s approach.</p>

<p>In a few minutes my small inclosure of palisades was filled
with armed and gibbering savages, while his majesty, in the red
coat of a British drummer, but without any trowsers, strutted
pompously into my presence. Of course, I assumed an air of
humble civility, and leading the potentate to one end of the guarded
piazza, where he was completely isolated from his people, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg&nbsp;338]</a></span>
stationed myself between the table and the <i>sombrero</i>. Some of
the prince&rsquo;s relations attempted to follow him within my inclosure,
but, according to established rules, they dared not advance beyond
an assigned limit.</p>

<p>When the formalities were over, a dead silence prevailed for
some minutes. I looked calmly and firmly into the prince&rsquo;s eyes,
and waited for him to speak. Still he was silent. At last, getting
tired of dumb-show, I asked the negro if he had &ldquo;come to
assist me in shipping my slaves; the sun is getting rather high,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and we had better begin without delay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you get my message?&rdquo; was his reply, &ldquo;and why haven&rsquo;t
you gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I received your message,&rdquo; returned I, &ldquo;but as I
came to New Sestros at my leisure, I intend to go away when it
suits me. Besides this, Prince Freeman, I have no fear that you
will do me the least harm, especially as I shall be <i>before</i> you in
any capers of that sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, by a sudden jerk, I threw off the blanket that hid the
exposed powder, and, with pistols in hand, one aimed at the keg
and the other at the king, I dared him to give an order for my
expulsion.</p>

<p>It is inconceivable how <i>moving</i> this process proved, not only
to Freeman, but to the crowd comprising his body-guard. The
poor blusterer, entirely cut off from big companions, was in a
laughable panic. His tawny skin became ashen, as he bounded
from his seat and rushed to the extremity of the piazza; and, to
make a long story short, in a few minutes he was as penitent and
humble as a dog.</p>

<p>I was, of course, not unforgiving, when Freeman advanced to
the rail, and warning the blacks that he had &ldquo;changed his mind,&rdquo;
ordered the odorous crowd out of my inclosure. Before the negroes
departed, however, I made him swear eternal fidelity and
friendship in their presence, after which I sealed the compact with
a couple of demijohns of New England rum.</p>

<p>Before sunset, seventy-five slaves were shipped for me in his
canoes, and ever after, Prince Freeman was a model monument of
the virtues of gunpowder physic!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg&nbsp;339]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LIV.</h2>


<p>The summary treatment of this ebony potentate convinced the
Kroo and Fishmen of New Sestros that they would find my breakfast
parties no child&rsquo;s play. Bold <i>bravado</i> had the best effect on the
adjacent inland as well as the immediate coast. The free blacks
not only treated my person and people with more respect, but
began to supply me with better grades of negroes; so that when
Don Pedro found my success increasing, he not only resolved to
establish a permanent factory, but enlarged my commission to ten
slaves for every hundred I procured. Thereupon, I at once commenced
the erection of buildings suitable for my personal comfort
and the security of slaves. I selected a pretty site closer to the
beach. A commodious two-story house, surrounded by double
verandahs, was topped by a look-out which commanded an ocean-view
of vast extent, and flanked by houses for all the necessities
of a first-rate factory. There were stores, a private kitchen, a
rice house, houses for domestic servants, a public workshop, a depot
for water, a slave-kitchen, huts for single men, and sheds under
which gangs were allowed to recreate from time to time during
daylight. The whole was surrounded by a tall hedge-fence, thickly
planted, and entered by a double gate, on either side of which
were long and separate <i>barracoons</i> for males and females. The
entrance of each slave-pen was commanded by a cannon, while in
the centre of the square, I left a vacant space, whereon I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg&nbsp;340]</a></span>
often seen seven hundred slaves, guarded by half a dozen musketeers,
singing, drumming and dancing, after their frugal meals.</p>

<p>It is a pleasant fancy of the natives, who find our surnames
rather difficult of pronunciation, while they know very little of
the Christian calendar, to baptize a new comer with some title,
for which, any chattel or merchandise that strikes their fancy, is
apt to stand godfather. My exploit with the prince christened
me &ldquo;Powder&rdquo; on the spot; but when they saw my magnificent
establishment, beheld the wealth of my warehouse, and heard the
name of &ldquo;store,&rdquo; I was forthwith whitewashed into &ldquo;<i>Storee</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And &ldquo;<i>Storee</i>,&rdquo; without occupying a legislative seat in Africa,
was destined to effect a rapid change in the motives and prospects
of that quarter. In a few months, New Sestros was alive.
The isolated beach, which before my arrival was dotted with half
a dozen Kroo hovels, now counted a couple of flourishing towns,
whose inhabitants were supplied with merchandise and labor in
my factory. The neighboring princes and chiefs, confident of
selling their captives, struggled to the sea-shore through the trackless
forest; and in a very brief period, Prince Freeman, who &ldquo;no
likee war&rdquo; over my powder-keg, sent expedition after expedition
against adjacent tribes, to redress imaginary grievances, or to settle
old bills with his great-grandfather&rsquo;s debtors. There was no absolute
idea of &ldquo;extending the area of freedom, or of territorial
annexation,&rdquo; but it was wonderful to behold how keen became the
sovereign&rsquo;s sensibility to national wrongs, and how patriotically
he labored to vindicate his country&rsquo;s rights. It is true, this African
metamorphosis was not brought about without some sacrifice
of humanity; still I am confident that during my stay, greater
strides were made towards modern civilization than during the
visit of any other factor. When I landed among the handful of
savages I found them given up to the basest superstition. All
classes of males as well as females, were liable to be accused upon
any pretext by the <i>juju-men</i> or priests, and the dangerous <i>saucy-wood</i>
potion was invariably administered to test their guilt or innocence.
It frequently happened that accusations of witchcraft
or evil practices were purchased from these wretches in order to
get rid of a sick wife, an imbecile parent, or an opulent relative;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg&nbsp;341]</a></span>
and, as the poisonous draught was mixed and graduated by the <i>juju-man</i>,
it rarely failed to prove fatal when the drinker&rsquo;s death was
necessary.<a name="FNanchor_F_13" id="FNanchor_F_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_13" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> Ordeals of this character occurred almost daily in the
neighboring country, of course destroying numbers of innocent
victims of cupidity or malice. I very soon observed the frequency
of this abominable crime, and when it was next attempted in the
little settlement that clustered around my factory, I respectfully
requested that the accused might be locked up <i>for safety in my
barracoon</i>, till the fatal liquid was prepared and the hour for its
administration arrived.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that the saucy-wood beverage,
like any other, may be prepared in various degrees of strength, so
that the operator has entire control of its noxious qualities. If
the accused has friends, either to pay or tamper with the medicator,
the draft is commonly made weak enough to insure its harmless
rejection from the culprit&rsquo;s stomach; but when the victim is
friendless, time is allowed for the entire venom to exude, and the
drinker dies ere he can drink the second bowl.</p>

<p>Very soon after the offer of my <i>barracoon</i> as a prison for the
accused, a Krooman was brought to it, accused of causing his
nephew&rsquo;s death by fatal incantations. The <i>juju</i> had been consulted
and confirmed the suspicion; whereupon the luckless negro
was seized, ironed, and delivered to my custody.</p>

<p>Next day early the <i>juju-man</i> ground his bark, mixed it with
water, and simmered the potion over a slow fire to extract the
poison&rsquo;s strength. As I had reason to believe that especial enmity
was entertained against the imprisoned uncle, I called at the
<i>juju&rsquo;s</i> hovel while the medication was proceeding, and, with the
bribe of a bottle, requested him to impart triple power to the
noxious draught. My own <i>juju</i>, I said, had nullified his by
pronouncing the accused innocent, and I was exceedingly anxious
to test the relative truth of our soothsayers.</p>

<p>The rascal promised implicit compliance, and I hastened back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg&nbsp;342]</a></span>
to the <i>barracoon</i> to await the fatal hour. Up to the very moment
of the draught&rsquo;s administration, I remained alone with the
culprit, and administering a double dose of tartar-emetic just
before the gate was opened, I led him forth loaded with irons.
The daring negro, strong in his truth, and confident of the white
man&rsquo;s superior witchcraft, swallowed the draught without a wink,
and in less than a minute, the rejected venom established his innocence,
and covered the African wizard with confusion.</p>

<p>This important trial and its results were of course noised
abroad throughout so superstitious and credulous a community.
The released Krooman told his companions of the &ldquo;white-man-saucy-wood,&rdquo;
administered by me in the <i>barracoon</i>; and, ever
afterwards, the accused were brought to my sanctuary where the
conflicting charm of my emetic soon conquered the native poison
and saved many a useful life. In a short time the malicious
practice was discontinued altogether.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>During the favorable season, I had been deprived of three
vessels by British cruisers, and, for as many months, had not
shipped a single slave,&mdash;five hundred of whom were now crowded
in my <i>barracoons</i>, and demanded our utmost vigilance for safe
keeping. In the gang, I found a family consisting of a man, his
wife, three children and a sister, all sold under an express obligation
of exile and slavery among Christians. The luckless
father was captured by my blackguard friend Prince Freeman in
person, and the family had been secured when the parents&rsquo; village
was subsequently stormed. Barrah was an outlaw and an
especial offender in the eyes of an African, though his faults were
hardly greater than the deeds that bestowed honor and knighthood
in the palmy days of our ancestral feudalism. Barrah was
the discarded son of a chief in the interior, and had presumed to
blockade the public path towards the beach, and collect duties
from transient passengers or caravans. This interfered with
Freeman and his revenues; but, in addition to the pecuniary
damage, the alleged robber ventured on several occasions to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg&nbsp;343]</a></span>
defeat and plunder the prince&rsquo;s vagabonds, so that, in time, he became
rich and strong enough to build a town and fortify it with
a regular stockade, <i>directly on the highway</i>! All these offences
were so heinous in the sight of my beach prince, that no foot was
suffered to cool till Barrah was captured. Once within his
power, Freeman would not have hesitated to kill his implacable
enemy as soon as delivered at New Sestros; but the interference
of friends, and, perhaps, the laudable conviction that a live negro
was worth more than a dead one, induced his highness to sell
him under pledge of Cuban banishment.</p>

<p>Barrah made several ineffectual attempts to break my <i>barracoon</i>
and elude the watchfulness of my guards, so that they were
frequently obliged to restrict his liberty, deprive him of comforts,
or add to his shackles. In fact, he was one of the most
formidable savages I ever encountered, even among the thousands
who passed in terrible procession before me in Africa.
One day he set fire to the bamboo-matting with which a portion
of the <i>barracoon</i> was sheltered from the sun, for which he was
severely lashed; but next day, when allowed, under pretence of
ague, to crawl with his heavy irons to the kitchen fire, he suddenly
dashed a brand into the thatch, and, seizing another, sprang
towards the powder-house, which his heavy shackles did not
allow him to reach before he was felled to the earth.</p>

<p>Freeman visited me soon afterwards, and, in spite of profit
and liquor, insisted on taking the brutal savage back; but, in
the mean time, the Bassa chief, to whom my prince was subordinate,
heard of Barrah&rsquo;s attempt on my magazine, and demanded
the felon to expiate his crime, according to the law of his country,
at the stake. No argument could appease the infuriate
judges, who declared that a cruel death would alone satisfy the
people whose lives had been endangered by the robber. Nevertheless,
I declined delivering the victim for such a fate, so that,
in the end, we compromised the sentence by shooting Barrah in
the presence of all the slaves and townsfolk,&mdash;the most unconcerned
spectators among whom were his wife and sister!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LV.</h2>


<p>There is no river at the New Sestros settlement, though geographers,
with their usual accuracy in African outlines, have often
projected one on charts and maps. Two miles from the short
and perilous beach where I built my <i>barracoons</i>, there was a
slender stream, which, in consequence of its shallow bed, and
narrow, rock-bound entrance, the natives call &ldquo;Poor River;&rdquo; but
my factory was at New Sestros <i>proper</i>; and there, as I have
said, there was no water outlet from the interior; in fact, nothing
but an embayed strand of two hundred yards, flanked by
dangerous cliffs. Such a beach, open to the broad ocean and for
ever exposed to the fall rage of its storms, is of course more or
less dangerous at all times for landing; and, even when the air
is perfectly calm, the common surf of the sea pours inward with
tremendous and combing waves, which threaten the boats of all
who venture among them without experienced skill. Indeed, the
landing at New Sestros would be impracticable were it not for
the dexterous Kroomen, whose canoes sever and surmount the billows
in spite of their terrific power.</p>

<p>Kroomen and Fishmen are different people from the Bushmen.
The two former classes inhabit the sea-shore exclusively,
and living apart from other African tribes, are governed by their
elders under a somewhat democratic system. The Bushmen do
not suffer the Kroos and Fishes to trade with the interior; but,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg&nbsp;345]</a></span>
in recompense for the monopoly of traffic with the strongholds of
Africa&rsquo;s heart, these expert boatmen maintain despotic sway
along the beach in trade with the shipping. As European or
Yankee boats cannot live in the surf I have described, the Kroo
and Fishmen have an advantage over their brothers of the Bush,
as well as over the whites, which they are not backward in using
to their profit. In fact, the Bushmen fight, travel, steal and
trade, while the Kroos and Fishes, who for ages have fringed at
least seven hundred miles of African coast, constitute the mariners,
without whose skill and boldness slaves would be drugs in
caravans or <i>barracoons</i>. And this is especially the case since
British, French, and American cruisers have driven the traffic
from every nook and corner of the west coast that even resembled
<i>a harbor</i>, and forced the slavers to lay in wait in open
roadsteads for their prey.</p>

<p>The Kroo canoe, wedge-like at both ends, is hollowed from
the solid trunk of a tree to the thickness of an inch. Of course
they are so light and buoyant that they not only lie like a feather
on the surface of the sea, so as to require nothing but freedom
from water for their safety, but a canoe, capable of containing
four people, may be borne on the shoulders of one or two to any
reasonable distance. Accordingly, Kroomen and Fishmen are
the prime pets of all slavers, traders, and men-of-war that frequent
the west coast of Africa; while no one dwelling on the
shore, engaged in commerce, is particularly anxious to merit or
receive their displeasure.</p>

<p>When I landed at New Sestros, I promptly supplied myself
with a little fleet of these amphibious natives; and, as the news
of my liberality spread north and south along the shore, the
number of my retainers increased with rapidity. Indeed, in six
months a couple of rival towns,&mdash;one of Kroos and the other of
Fishes,&mdash;hailed me severally as their &ldquo;Commodore&rdquo; and &ldquo;Consul.&rdquo;
With such auxiliaries constantly at hand, I rarely feared
the surf when the shipment of slaves was necessary. At Gallinas,
under the immediate eye of Don Pedro, the most elaborate
care was taken to secure an ample supply of these people and
their boats, and I doubt not that the multitude employed in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg&nbsp;346]</a></span>
establishment&rsquo;s prime, could, at a favorable moment, despatch
at least a thousand slaves within the space of four hours. Yet
I have heard from Kroomen at Gallinas the most harrowing tales
of disaster connected with the shipment of negroes from that
perilous bar. Even in the dry season, the mouth of this river is
frequently dangerous, and, with all the adroitness they could
display, the Kroos could not save boat-load after boat-load from
becoming food for the ravenous sharks!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I was quite afloat at New Sestros on the tide of success, when
the cruiser that for a while had annoyed me with a blockade, became
short of food, and was obliged to bear away for Sierra Leone.
My well paid spy&mdash;a Krooman who had been employed by the
cruiser&mdash;soon apprised me of the brig&rsquo;s departure and its cause;
so that in an hour the beach was in a bustle, despatching a swift
canoe to Gallinas with a message to Don Pedro:&mdash;&ldquo;The coast is
clear:&mdash;send me a vessel:&mdash;relieve my plethora!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Forty-eight hours were hardly over when the twin masts of a
clipper brig were seen scraping along the edge of the horizon,
with the well-known signal for &ldquo;embarkation.&rdquo; I was undoubtedly
prepared to welcome my guest, for Kroos, Fishes, Bushmen,
Bassas and all, had been alert since daybreak, ready to hail the
craft and receive their fees. There had been a general embargo
on all sea-going folks for a day before, so that there was not a
fish to be had for love or money in the settlement. Minute precautions
like these are absolutely necessary for all prudent
slavers, for it was likely that the cruiser kept a spy in her pay
among <i>my</i> people, as well as I did among <i>hers</i>!</p>

<p>All, therefore, was exceedingly comfortable, so far as ordinary
judgment could foresee; but alas! the moon was full, and the
African surf at such periods is fearfully terrific. As I listened
from my piazza or gazed from my <i>bellevue</i>, it roared on the
strand like the charge of interminable cavalry. My watchful
enemy had been several days absent, and I expected her return
from hour to hour. The shipment, though extremely perilous, was,
therefore indispensable; and four short hours of daylight alone
remained to complete it. I saw the risk, yet, taking counsel with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg&nbsp;347]</a></span>
the head Kroo and Fishmen, I persuaded them, under the provocation
of triple reward, to attempt the enterprise with the smallest
skiffs and stoutest rowers, while a band of lusty youths stood by
to plunge in whenever the breakers capsized a canoe.</p>

<p>We began with females, as the most difficult cargo for embarkation,
and seventy reached the brig safely. Then followed
the stronger sex; but by this time a sea-breeze set in from the
south-west like a young gale, and driving the rollers with greater
rapidity, upset almost every alternate cockleshell set adrift with
its living freight. It was fortunate that our sharks happened
that evening to be on a frolic elsewhere, so that negro after negro
was rescued from the brine, though the sun was rapidly sinking
when but two thirds of my slaves were safely shipped.</p>

<p>I ran up and down the beach, in a fever of anxiety, shouting,
encouraging, coaxing, appealing, and <i>refreshing</i> the boatmen
and swimmers; but as the gangs came ashore, they sank exhausted
on the beach, refusing to stir. Rum, which hitherto
roused them like electricity, was now powerless. Powder they
did not want, nor muskets, nor ordinary trade stuff, for they
never engaged in kidnapping or slave wars.</p>

<p>As night approached the wind increased. <i>There</i> was the brig
with topsails aback, signalling impatiently for despatch; but never
was luckless factor more at fault! I was on the eve of giving
up in despair, when a bright flash brought to recollection a
quantity of Venetian beads of mock coral which I had stowed in
my chest. They happened, at that moment, to be the rage among
the girls of our beach, and were of course irresistible keys to the
heart of every belle. Now the smile of a lip has the same magical
power in Africa as elsewhere; and the offer of a coral bunch for
each head embarked, brought all the dames and damsels of Sestros
to my aid. Such a shower of chatter was never heard out of a
canary cage. Mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, sweethearts, took
charge of the embarkation by coaxing or commanding their respective
gentlemen; and, before the sun&rsquo;s rim dipped below the
horizon, a few strands of false coral, or the kiss of a negro wench,
sent one hundred more of the Africans into Spanish slavery.</p>

<p>But this effort exhausted my people. The charm of beads
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg&nbsp;348]</a></span>
and beauty was over: Three slaves found a tomb in the sharks,
or a grave in the deep, while the brig took flight in the darkness
without the remaining one hundred and twenty I had designed
for her hold.</p>

<p>Next morning the cruiser loomed once more in the offing,
and, in a fit of impetuous benevolence, I hurried a Krooman
aboard, with the offer of my compliments, and a <i>sincere</i> hope that
I could render some service!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg&nbsp;349]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVI.</h2>


<p>About this time, a Spanish vessel from the Canaries, laden with
fruit, the greater part of which had been sold at Goree, Sierra
Leone, Gallinas, and Cape Mesurado, dropped anchor opposite
my little roadstead with a letter from Blanco. The Spaniard
had been chartered by the Don to bring from the Grain Coast a
cargo of rice, which he was to collect under my instructions.</p>

<p>My <i>barracoons</i> happened to be just then pretty bare, and as
the season did not require my presence in the factory for trade,
it struck me that I could not pass a few weeks more agreeably,
and ventilate my jaded faculties more satisfactorily, than by
throwing my carpet-bag on the Brilliant, and purchasing the
cargo myself.</p>

<p>In the prosecution of this little adventure, I called along the
coast with cash at several English factories, where I obtained
rice; and on my return anchored off the river to purchase sea-stores.
Here I found Governor Findley, chief of the colony,
laboring under a protracted illness which refused yielding to
medicine, but might, probably, be relieved by a voyage, even of
a few days, in the pure air of old Neptune. Slaver as I was, I
contrived never to omit a civility to gentlemen on the coast
of Africa; and I confess I was proud of the honorable service,
when Governor Findley accepted the Brilliant for a trip along
the coast. He proposed visiting Monrovia and Bassa; and after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg&nbsp;350]</a></span>
landing at some port in that quarter to await the captain&rsquo;s return
from windward.</p>

<p>I fanned along the coast as slowly as I could, to give the
Governor every possible chance to recruit his enervated frame
by change of air; but, as I looked in at New Sestros in passing,
I found three trading vessels with cargoes of merchandise to my
consignment, so that I was obliged to abandon my trip and return
to business. I left the Governor, however, in excellent hands,
and directed the captain to land him at Bassa, await his pleasure
three days, and finally, to bear him to Monrovia, the last place
he desired visiting.</p>

<p>The Rio San Juan or Grand Bassa, is only fourteen miles
north-west of New Sestros, yet it was near nightfall when the
Brilliant approached the river landing. The Spaniard advised
his guest not to disembark till next morning, but the Governor was
so restless and anxious about delay, that he declined our captain&rsquo;s
counsel, and went ashore at a native town, with the design of
crossing on foot the two miles of beach to the American settlement.</p>

<p>As Findley went over the Brilliant&rsquo;s side into the Krooman&rsquo;s
canoe, the jingle of silver was heard in his pocket; and warning
was given him either to hide his money or leave it on board.
But the Governor smiled at the caution, and disregarding it entirely,
threw himself into the African skiff.</p>

<p>Night fell. The curtain of darkness dropped over the coast and
sea. Twice the sun rose and set without word from the Governor.
At last, my delayed mariner became impatient if not anxious,
and despatched one of my servants who spoke English, in search
of Mr. Findley at the American Settlement. <i>No one had seen
or heard of him!</i> But, hurrying homeward from his fruitless
errand, my boy followed the winding beach, and half way to the
vessel found a human body, its head gashed with a deep wound,
floating and beating against the rocks. He could not recognize
the features of the battered face; but the well-remembered
garments left no doubt on the servant&rsquo;s mind that the corpse was
Findley&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The frightful story was received with dismay on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg&nbsp;351]</a></span>
Brilliant, whose captain, unfamiliar with the coast and its people,
hesitated to land, with the risk of treachery or ambush, even to
give a grave to the dust of his wretched passenger. In this
dilemma he thought best to run the fourteen miles to New Sestros,
where he might counsel with me before venturing ashore.</p>

<p>Whatever personal anxiety may have flashed athwart my mind
when I heard of the death of a colonial governor while enjoying
the hospitality of myself,&mdash;a slaver,&mdash;the thought vanished as
quickly as it was conceived. In an instant I was busy with
detection and revenge.</p>

<p>It happened that the three captains had already landed the
cargoes to my consignment, so that their empty vessels were lying
at anchor in the roads, and the officers ready to aid me in any
enterprise I deemed feasible. My colleagues were from three
nations:&mdash;one was a Spaniard, another a Portuguese, and the last
American.</p>

<p>Next morning I was early aboard the Spaniard, and sending
for the Portuguese skipper, we assembled the crew. I dwelt
earnestly and heartily on the insult the Castilian flag had received
by the murder of an important personage while protected by its
folds. I demonstrated the necessity there was for prompt chastisement
of the brutal crime, and concluded by informing the
crowd, that their captains had resolved to aid me in vindicating
our banner. When I ventured to hope that <i>the men</i> would not
hesitate to back their officers, a general shout went up that they
were ready to land and punish the negroes.</p>

<p>As soon as the enterprise was known on board the American,
her captain insisted on volunteering in the expedition; and by
noon, our little squadron was under way, with fifty muskets in the
cabins.</p>

<p>The plan I roughly proposed, was, under the menacing appearance
of this force, to demand the murderer or murderers of
Governor Findley, and to execute them, either on his grave, or the spot
where his corpse was found. Failing in this, I intended to
land portions of the crews, and destroy the towns nearest the
theatre of the tragedy.</p>

<p>The sun was still an hour or more high, when we sailed in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg&nbsp;352]</a></span>
line past the native towns along the fatal beach, and displayed our
flags and pennants. Off the Rio San Joan, we tacked in man-of-war
fashion, and returning southward, each vessel took post opposite
a different town as if to command it.</p>

<p>While I had been planning and executing these man&oelig;uvres,
the colonial settlers had heard of the catastrophe, and found poor
Findley&rsquo;s mangled corpse. At the moment of our arrival off the
river&rsquo;s mouth, an anxious council of resolute men was discussing
the best means of chastising the savages. When my servant
inquired for the governor he had spoken of him as a passenger in
the Spanish craft, so that the parade of our vessels alongshore
and in front of the native towns, betokened, they thought, co-operation
on the part of the Mongo of New Sestros.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we had not been long at anchor before Governor
Johnson despatched a Krooman to know whether I was aboard a
friendly squadron; and, if so, he trusted I would land at once,
and unite with his forces in the intended punishment.</p>

<p>In the interval, however, the cunning savages who soon found
out that we had no cannons, flocked to the beach, and as they were
beyond musket shot, insulted us by gestures, and defied a battle.</p>

<p>Of course no movement was made against the blacks that
night, but it was agreed in council at the American settlement,
that the expedition, supported by a field piece, should advance
next day by the beach, where I could reinforce it with my seamen
a short distance from the towns.</p>

<p>Punctual to the moment, the colonial flag, with drum and fife,
appeared on the sea-shore at nine in the morning, followed by some
forty armed men, dragging their cannon. Five boats, filled with
sailors instantly left our vessels to support the attack, and, by this
time, the colonists had reached a massive rock which blocked the
beach like a bulwark, and was already possessed by the natives.
My position, in flank, made my force most valuable in dislodging
the foe, and of course I hastened my oars to open the passage. As
I was altogether ignorant of the numbers that might be hidden
and lurking in the dense jungle that was not more than fifty feet
from the water&rsquo;s edge, I kept my men afloat within musket shot,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg&nbsp;353]</a></span>
and, with a few rounds of ball cartridge purged the rock of its
defenders, though but a single savage was mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Upon this, the colonists advanced to the vacant bulwark, and
were joined by our reinforcement. Wheeler, who commanded
the Americans, proposed that we should march in a compact body
to the towns, and give battle to the blacks if they held out in their
dwellings. But his plan was not executed, for, before we reached
the negro huts, we were assailed from the bushes and jungle.
Their object was to keep hidden within the dense underwood; to
shoot and run; while we, entirely exposed on the ocean shore, were
obliged to remain altogether on the defensive by dodging the balls,
or to fire at the smoke of an unseen enemy. Occasionally, large
numbers of the savages would appear at a distance beyond musket
range, and tossing their guns and lances, or brandishing their
cutlasses, would present their naked limbs to our gaze, slap their
shining flanks, and disappear! But this diverting exercise was
not repeated very often. A sturdy colonist, named Bear, who
carried a long and heavy old-fashioned <i>rifle</i>, took rest on my
shoulder, and, when the next party of annoying jokers displayed
their personal charms, laid its leader in the dust by a Yankee
ball. Our cannon and blunderbusses were next brought into play
to scour the jungle and expel the marksmen, who, confident in the
security of their impervious screen, began to fire among us with
more precision than was desirable. A Krooman of our party was
killed, and a colonist severely wounded. Small sections of our
two commands advanced at a run, and fired a volley into the bushes,
while the main body of the expedition hastened along the beach
towards the towns. By repeating this process several times, we
were enabled, without further loss, to reach the first settlement.</p>

<p>Here, of course, we expected to find the savages arrayed in
force to defend their roof-trees, but when we entered the place
cautiously, and crept to the first dwelling in the outskirt, it was
empty. So with the second, third, fourth,&mdash;until we overran
the whole settlement and found it utterly deserted;&mdash;its furniture,
stock, implements, and even <i>doors</i> carried off by the deliberate
fugitives. The guardian <i>fetiche</i> was alone left to protect
their abandoned hovels. But the superstitious charm did not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg&nbsp;354]</a></span>
save them. The brand was lighted; and, in an hour, five of
these bamboo confederacies were given to the flames.</p>

<p>We discovered while approaching the towns, that our assault
had made so serious an inroad on the slim supply of ammunition,
that it was deemed advisable to send a messenger to the colony
for a reinforcement. By neglect or mishap, the powder and ball
never reached us; so that when the towns were destroyed, no
one dreamed of penetrating the forest to unearth its vermin with
the remnant of cartridges in our chest and boxes. I never was
able to discover the cause of this unpardonable neglect, or the
officer who permitted it to occur in such an exigency; but it was
forthwith deemed advisable to waste no time in retreating after
our partial revenge.</p>

<p>Till now, the Africans had kept strictly on the defensive, but
when they saw our faces turned towards the beach, or colony,
every bush and thicket became alive again with aggressive foes.
For a while, the cannon kept them at bay, but its grape soon
gave out; and, while I was in the act of superintending a fair
division of the remaining ball cartridges, I was shot in the right
foot with an iron slug. At the moment of injury I scarcely
felt the wound, and did not halt, but, as I trudged along in the
sand and salt water, my wound grew painful, and the loss of
blood which tracked my steps, soon obliged me to seek refuge in
the canoe of my Kroomen.</p>

<p>The sight of my bleeding body borne to the skiff, was hailed
with shouts and gestures of joy and contempt by the savages. As
I crossed the last breaker and dropped into smooth water, my
eyes reverted to the beach, where I heard the exultant war-drum
and war bells, while the colonists were beheld in full flight,
leaving their artillery in the hands of our foe! It was subsequently
reported that the commander of the party had been
panic struck by the perilous aspect of affairs, and ordered the
precipitate and fatal retreat, which that very night emboldened
the negroes to revenge the loss of their towns by the conflagration
of Bassa-Cove.</p>

<p>Next day, my own men, and the volunteers from our Spanish,
Portuguese and American vessels, were sent on board, eight of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg&nbsp;355]</a></span>
them bearing marks of the fray, which fortunately proved neither
fatal nor dangerous. The shameful flight of my comrades not
only gave heart to the blacks, but spread its cowardly panic
among the resident colonists. The settlement, they told me,
was in danger of attack, and although my wound and the disaster
both contributed to excite me against the fugitives, I did not
quit the San Juan without reinforcing Governor Johnson with
twenty muskets and some kegs of powder.</p>

<p>I have dwelt rather tediously perhaps on this sad occurrence&mdash;but
I have a reason. Governor Findley&rsquo;s memory was, at this
time, much vilified on the coast, because that functionary had accepted
the boon of a passage in the Brilliant, which was falsely declared
to be &ldquo;a Spanish slaver.&rdquo; There were some among the
overrighteous who even went so far as to proclaim his death &ldquo;a
judgment for venturing on the deck of such a vessel!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As no one took the trouble to investigate the facts and contradict
the malicious lie, I have thought it but justice to tell
the entire story, and exculpate a gentleman who met a terrible
death in the bold prosecution of his duty.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg&nbsp;356]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LVII.</h2>


<p>I took the earliest opportunity to apprise Don Pedro Blanco of
the mishap that had befallen his factor&rsquo;s limb, so that I might
receive the prompt aid of an additional clerk to attend the more
active part of our business. Don Pedro&rsquo;s answer was extremely
characteristic. The letter opened with a draft for five hundred
dollars, which he authorized me to bestow on the widow and
orphans of Governor Findley, if he left a family. The slaver of
Gallinas then proceeded to comment upon my Quixotic expedition;
and, in gentle terms, intimated a decided censure for my
immature attempt to chastise the negroes. He did not disapprove
my <i>motives</i>; but considered any revengeful assault on the
natives unwise, unless every precaution had previously been
taken to insure complete success. Don Pedro hoped that, henceforth,
I would take things more coolly, so as not to hazard either
my life or his property; and concluded the epistle by superscribing
it:</p>

<p><span class="receipt1">&ldquo;To</span><br />
<span class="receipt2">&ldquo;<i>Se&ntilde;or</i> <span class="smcap">Powder</span>,<br /></span>
<span class="receipt3">&ldquo;<i>at his Magazine</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="receipt4">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New Sestros</span>.&rdquo;<br /></span></p>


<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>The slug that struck the upper part of my foot, near the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg&nbsp;357]</a></span>
ankle joint, tore my flesh and tendons with a painfully dangerous
wound, which, for nine months, kept me a prisoner on
crutches. During the long and wearying confinement which almost
broke my restless heart, I had little to do save to superintend
the general fortunes of our factory. Now and then, an incident
occurred to relieve the monotony of my sick chair, and make me
forget, for a moment, the pangs of my crippled limb. One of
these events flashes across my memory as I write, in the shape
of a letter which was mysteriously delivered at my landing by a
coaster, and came from poor Joseph, my ancient partner on the
Rio Pongo. Coomba&rsquo;s spouse was in trouble! and the ungrateful
scamp, though forgetful of my own appeals from the <i>Chateau
of Brest</i>, did not hesitate to claim my brotherly aid. Captured
in a Spanish slaver, and compromised beyond salvation, Joseph
had been taken into Sierra Leone, where he was now under sentence
of transportation. The letter hinted that a liberal sum
might purchase his escape, even from the tenacious jaws of the
British lion; and when I thought of old times, the laughable
marriage ceremony, and the merry hours we enjoyed at Kambia,
I forgave his neglect. A draft on Don Pedro was readily cashed
at Sierra Leone, notwithstanding the paymaster was a slaver and
the jurisdiction that of St. George and his Cross. The transaction,
of course, was &ldquo;purely commercial,&rdquo; and, therefore, sinless;
so that, in less than a month, Joseph and the bribed
turnkey were on their way to the Rio Pongo.</p>

<p>By this time the sub-factory of New Sestros was somewhat
renowned in Cuba and Porto Rico. Our dealings with commanders,
the character of my cargoes, and the rapidity with which I
despatched a customer and his craft were proverbial in the islands.
Indeed, the third year of my lodgment had not rolled over, before
the slave-demand was so great, that in spite of rum, cottons,
muskets, powder, kidnapping and Prince Freeman&rsquo;s wars, the
country could not supply our demand.</p>

<p>To aid New Sestros, I had established several <i>nurseries</i>, or
junior factories, at Little Bassa and Digby; points a few miles
from the limits of Liberia. These &ldquo;chapels of ease&rdquo; furnished
my parent <i>barracoons</i> with young and small negroes, mostly
kidnapped, I suppose, in the neighborhood of the beach.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg&nbsp;358]</a></span>
When I was perfectly cured of the injury I sustained in my
first philanthropic fight, I loaded my spacious cutter with a
choice collection of trade-goods, and set sail one fine morning
for this outpost at Digby. I designed, also, if advisable, to
erect another receiving <i>barracoon</i> under the lee of Cape
Mount.</p>

<p>But my call at Digby was unsatisfactory. The pens were
vacant, and our merchandise squandered <i>on credit</i>. This put
me in a very uncomfortable passion, which would have rendered
an interview between &ldquo;Mr. Powder&rdquo; and his agent any thing
but pleasant or profitable, had that personage been at his post.
Fortunately, however, for both of us, he was abroad carousing
with &ldquo;a <i>king</i>;&rdquo; so that I refused landing a single yard of merchandise,
and hoisted sail for the next village.</p>

<p>There I transacted business in regular &ldquo;ship-shape.&rdquo; Our
rum was plenteously distributed and established an <i>entente cordiale</i>
which would have charmed a diplomatist at his first dinner in a
new capital. The naked blackguards flocked round me like
crows, and I clothed their loins in parti-colored calicoes that
enriched them with a plumage worthy of parrots. I was the
prince of good fellows in &ldquo;every body&rsquo;s&rdquo; opinion; and, in five
days, nineteen newly-&ldquo;<i>conveyed</i>&rdquo; darkies were exchanged for
London muskets, Yankee grog, and Manchester cottons!</p>

<p>My cutter, though but twenty-seven feet long, was large
enough to stow my gang, considering that the voyage was short,
and the slaves but boys and girls; so I turned my prow homeward
with contented spirit and promising skies. Yet, before
night, all was changed. Wind and sea rose together. The sun
sank in a long streak of blood. After a while, it rained in terrible
squalls; till, finally, darkness caught me in a perfect gale. So
high was the surf and so shelterless the coast, that it became
utterly impossible to make a lee of any headland where we might
ride out the storm in safety. Our best hope was in the cutter&rsquo;s
ability to keep the open sea without swamping; and, accordingly,
under the merest patch of sail, I coasted the perilous breakers,
guided by their roar, till day-dawn. But, when the sun lifted
over the horizon,&mdash;peering for an instant through a rent in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg&nbsp;359]</a></span>
storm-cloud, and then disappearing behind the gray vapor,&mdash;I
saw at once that the coast offered no chance of landing our
blacks at some friendly town. Every where the bellowing shore
was lashed by surf, impracticable even for the boats and skill of
Kroomen. On I dashed, therefore, driving and almost burying
the cutter, with loosened reef, till we came opposite Monrovia;
where, safe in the absence of cruisers, I crept at dark under the
lee of the cape, veiling my cargo with our useless sails.</p>

<p>Sunset &ldquo;killed the wind,&rdquo; enabling us to be off again at
dawn; yet hardly were we clear of the cape, when both gale and
current freshened from the old quarter, holding us completely
in check. Nevertheless, I kept at sea till evening, and then
sneaked back to my protecting anchorage.</p>

<p>By this time, my people and slaves were well-nigh famished,
for their sole food had been a scant allowance of raw <i>cassava</i>.
Anxiety, toil, rain, and drenching spray, broke their spirits.
The blacks, from the hot interior, and now for the first time off
their mother earth, suffered not only from the inclement weather,
but groaned with the terrible pangs of sea-sickness. I resolved,
therefore, if possible, to refresh the drooping gang by a hot meal;
and, beneath the shelter of a tarpaulin, contrived to cook a mess
of rice. Warm food comforted us astonishingly; but, alas! the
next day was a picture of the past! A slave&mdash;cramped and
smothered amid the crowd that soaked so long in the salt water
at our boat&rsquo;s bottom&mdash;died during the darkness. Next morning,
the same low, leaden, coffin-lid sky, hung like a pall over sea and
shore. Wind in terrific blasts, and rain in deluging squalls,
howled and beat on us. Come what might, I resolved not to
stir! All day I kept my people beneath the sails, with orders
to move their limbs as much as possible, in order to overcome the
benumbing effect of moisture and packed confinement. The incessant
drenching from sea and sky to which they had been so
long subjected, chilled their slackened circulation to such a degree,
that death from torpor seemed rapidly supervening. Motion,
motion, motion, was my constant command; but I hoarded
my alcohol for the last resource.</p>

<p>I saw that no time was to be lost, and that nothing but a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg&nbsp;360]</a></span>
bold encounter of hazard would save either lives or property.
Before dark my mind was made up as to the enterprise. I would
land in the neighborhood of the colony, and cross its territory
during the shadow of night!</p>

<p>I do not suppose that the process by which I threw my stiffened
crew on the beach, and revived them with copious draughts
of brandy, would interest the reader; <i>but midnight did not
strike before my cargo, under the escort of Kroo guides, was
boldly marched through the colonial town, and safe on its way
to New Sestros!</i> Fortunately for my dare-devil adventure, the
tropical rain poured down in ceaseless torrents, compelling the
unsuspicious colonists to keep beneath their roofs. Indeed, no
one dreamed of a forced march by human beings on that dreadful
night of tempest, else it might have gone hard had I been detected
in the desecration of colonial soil. Still I was prepared for
all emergencies. I never went abroad without the two great
keys of Africa&mdash;gold and fire-arms; and had it been my lot to
encounter a colonist, he would either have learned the value of
silence, or have been carried along, under the muzzle of a pistol,
till the gang was in safety.</p>

<p>While it was still dark, I left the caravan advancing by an
interior path to Little Bassa, where one of my branches could
furnish it with necessaries to cross the other colony of Bassa San
Juan, so as to reach my homestead in the course of three days.
Meanwhile I retraced my way to Monrovia, and, reaching it by
sunrise, satisfied the amiable colonists that I had just taken shelter
in their harbor, and was fresh from my dripping cutter. It
is very likely that no one in the colony to the present day knows
the true story of this adventure, or would believe it unless <i>confessed</i>
by me.</p>

<p>It was often my fate in Africa, and elsewhere, to hear gossips
declare that colonists were no better than others who dwelt amid
coast temptations, and that they were sometimes even willing to
back a certain Don Theodore Canot, if not absolutely to share
his slave-trade! I never thought it prudent to exculpate those
honorable emigrants who were consolidating the first colonial
lodgments from the United States; for I believed that <i>my</i> denial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg&nbsp;361]</a></span>
would only add sarcastic venom to the scandal of vilifiers.
But now that my African career is over, and the slave-trade a
mere tradition in the neighborhood of Liberia, I may assure the
friends of colonization, that, in all my negro traffic, no American
settler gave assistance or furnished merchandise which I could not
have obtained at the most loyal establishments of Britain or
France. I think it will be granted by unprejudiced people, that
the colonist who sold me a few pieces of cloth, lodged me in travelling,
or gave me his labor for my flesh-colored gold, participated
no more in the African slave-trade than the European or
American supercargo who sold assorted cargoes, selected with
the most deliberate judgment in London, Paris, Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, or Baltimore, expressly to suit the well-known
cupidity of my warriors, kidnappers, and slave merchants.</p>

<p>Commerce is sometimes an adroit metaphysican&mdash;but a bad
moralist!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVIII.</h2>


<p>It was my invariable custom whenever a vessel made her appearance
in the roadstead of New Sestros, to despatch my canoe
with &ldquo;Captain Canot&rsquo;s compliments;&rdquo; nor did I omit this graceful
courtesy when his Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s cruisers did me the
honor of halting in my neighborhood to watch or destroy my operations.
At such times I commonly increased the politeness by
an offer of my services, and a tender of provisions, or of any commodity
the country could supply!</p>

<p>I remember an interesting rencounter of this sort with the
officers of the brig of war Bonito. My note was forwarded by a
trusty Krooman, even before her sails were furled, but the courteous
offer was respectfully declined &ldquo;<i>for the present</i>.&rdquo; The captain
availed himself, however, of my messenger&rsquo;s return, to announce
that the &ldquo;commodore in command of the African squadron
had specially deputed the Bonito <i>to blockade</i> New Sestros,
for which purpose she was provisioned for <i>six months</i>, and ordered
not to budge from her anchorage till relieved by a
cruiser!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This formidable announcement was, of course, intended to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg&nbsp;363]</a></span>
strike me with awe. The captain hoped in conclusion, that I
would see the folly of prosecuting my abominable traffic in the
face of such a disastrous <i>vis &agrave; vis</i>; nor could he refrain from intimating
his surprise that a man of my reputed character and
ability, would consent to manacle and starve the unfortunate negroes
who were now suffering in my <i>barracoons</i>.</p>

<p>I saw at once from this combined attack of fear and flattery,
backed by blockade, that his majesty&rsquo;s officer had either been
grossly misinformed, or believed that a scarcity of rice prevailed
in my establishment as well as elsewhere along the coast.</p>

<p>The suspicion of <i>starving blacks in chains</i>, was not only pathetic
but mortifying! It was part of the sentimental drapery of
British reports and despatches, to which I became accustomed
in Africa. I did not retort upon my dashing captain with a
sneer at his ancestors who had taught the traffic to Spaniards,
yet I resolved not to let his official communications reach the
British admiralty with a fanciful tale about <i>my</i> barracoons and
starvation. Accordingly, without more ado, I sent a second <i>billet</i>
to the Bonito, desiring her captain or any of her officers to
visit New Sestros, and ascertain personally the condition of my
establishment.</p>

<p>Strange to tell, my invitation was accepted; and at noon a
boat with a white flag, appeared on the edge of the surf, conveying
two officers to my beach. The surgeon and first lieutenant
were my visitors. I welcomed them most cordially to my cottage,
and as soon as the customary refreshments were despatched,
proposed a glance at the dreadful <i>barracoons</i>.</p>

<p>As well as I now remember, there must have been at least
five hundred slaves in my two pens, sleek in flesh, happy in
looks, and ready for the first customer who could outwit the
cruiser. I quietly despatched a notice of our advent to the <i>barracooniers</i>,
with directions as to their conduct, so that the moment
my naval friends entered the stanch inclosures, full two
hundred and fifty human beings, in each, rose to their feet and
saluted the strangers with long and reiterated clapping. This
sudden and surprising demonstration somewhat alarmed my
guests at its outburst, and made them retreat a pace towards the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg&nbsp;364]</a></span>
door,&mdash;perhaps in fear of treachery;&mdash;but when they saw the
smiling faces and heard the pleased chatter of my people, they
soon came forward to learn that the compliment was worth a customary
<i>demijohn of rum</i>.</p>

<p>The adventure was a fortunate one for the reputation of New
Sestros, Don Pedro my employer, and Don T&eacute;odor, his clerk.
Our establishment happened just then to be at a summit of
material comfort rarely exceeded or even reached by others. My
pens were full of slaves; my granary, of rice; my stores, of
merchandise.</p>

<p>From house to house,&mdash;from hut to hut,&mdash;the sailor and saw-bones
wandered with expressions of perfect admiration, till the
hour for dinner approached. I ordered the meal to be administered
with minute attention to all our usual ceremonies. The
washing, singing, distribution of food, beating time, and all the
prandial <i>etceteras</i> of comfort, were performed with the utmost
precision and cleanliness. They could not believe that such was
the ordinary routine of slave life in <i>barracoons</i>, but ventured to
hint that I must have got up the drama for their special diversion,
and that it was impossible for such to be the ordinary drill
and demeanor of Africans. Our dapper little surgeon, with almost
dissective inquisitiveness, pried into every nook and corner;
and at length reached the slave kitchen, where a caldron was
full and bubbling with the most delicious rice. Hard by stood
a pot, simmering with meat and soup, and in an instant the doctor
had a morsel between his fingers and brought his companion
to follow his example.</p>

<p>Now, in sober truth, this was no casual display got up for
effect, but the common routine of an establishment conducted
with prudent foresight, for the profit of its owners as well as
the comfort of our people. And yet, such was the fanatical prepossession
of these Englishmen, whose idea of Spanish <i>factories</i>
and <i>barracoons</i> was formed exclusively from exaggerated reports,
that I could not satisfy them of my truth till I produced our
journal, in which I noted minutely every item of daily expenditure.
It must be understood, however, that it was not my habit
to give the slaves <i>meat</i> every day of the week. Such a diet would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg&nbsp;365]</a></span>
not be prudent, because it is not habitual with the majority of
negroes. Two bullocks were slaughtered each week for the use
of my <i>factory</i>, while the hide, head, blood, feet, neck, tail, and
entrails, were appropriated for broth in the <i>barracoons</i>. It happened
that my visitors arrived on the customary day of our
butchering.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>A stinging appetite was the natural result of our review, and
while the naval guests were whetting it still more, I took the opportunity
to slip out of my verandah with orders for our harbor-pilot
to report the beach &ldquo;impracticable for boats,&rdquo;&mdash;a report
which no prudent sailor on the coast ever disregards. Meanwhile,
I despatched a Krooman with a note to the Bonito&rsquo;s captain, notifying
that personage of the marine hazard that prevented his
officers&rsquo; immediate return, and fearing they might even find it
necessary to tarry over night. This little <i>ruse</i> was an <i>impromptu</i>
device to detain my inspectors, and make us better acquainted
over the African <i>cuisine</i>, which, by this time was smoking
in tureens and dishes flanked by spirited sentinels, in black
uniform, of claret and eau de vie.</p>

<p>Our dinner-chat was African all over: slavery, cruisers, prize-money,
captures, war, negro-trade, and philanthropy! The surgeon
melted enough under the blaze of the bottle to admit, <i>as a
philosopher</i>, that Cuffee was happier in the hands of white men
than of black, and that he would even support the institution if
it could be carried on with a little more humanity and less bloodshed.
The lieutenant saw nothing, even through the &ldquo;Spiritual
Medium&rdquo; of our flagons, save prize-money and obedience to the
Admiral; while Don T&eacute;odor became rather tart on the service,
and confessed that his incredulity of British philanthropy
would never cease till England abandoned her Indian wars, her
opium smuggling, and her persecution of the Irish!</p>

<p>In truth, these loyal subjects of the King, and the Spanish slaver
became most excellent friends before bed-time, and ended the
evening by a visit to Prince Freeman, who forthwith got up a
negro dance and jollification for our special entertainment.</p>

<p>I have not much recollection after the end of this savage frolic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg&nbsp;366]</a></span>
till my &ldquo;look-out&rdquo; knocked at the door with the news that our
brig was firing for her officers, while a suspicious sail flitted along
the horizon.</p>

<p>All good sailors sleep with one eye and ear open, so that in a
twinkling the lieutenant was afoot making for the beach, and calling
for the surgeon to follow. &ldquo;A canoe! a canoe! a canoe!&rdquo;
shouted the gallant blade, while he ran to and fro on the edge of
the surf, beholding signal after signal from his vessel. But alas!
for the British navy,&mdash;out of all the Kroo spectators not one
stirred hand or foot for the royal officer. Next came the jingle of
dollars, and the offer of twenty to the boatmen who would launch
their skiff and put them on board. &ldquo;No savez! No savez! ax
Commodore! ax Consul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curse your Commodore and Consul!&rdquo; yelled the Lieutenant,
as the surgeon came up with the vociferous group: &ldquo;put us aboard
and be paid, or I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; interposed my pacific saw-bones, &ldquo;no swearing
and no threats, lieutenant. One&rsquo;s just as useless as the other.
First of all, the Bonito&rsquo;s off about her business;&mdash;and next, my
dear fellow, the chase she&rsquo;s after is one of Canot&rsquo;s squadron, and,
of course, there&rsquo;s an embargo on every canoe along this beach!
The Commodore&rsquo;s altogether <i>too cute</i>, as the Yankees say, to
reinforce his enemy with officers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>During this charming little episode of my <i>blockade</i>, I was
aloft in my bellevieu, watching the progress of the chase; and as
both vessels kept steadily northward they soon disappeared behind
the land.</p>

<p>By this time it was near breakfast, and, with a good appetite,
I descended to the verandah, with as unconcerned an air as if
nothing had occurred beyond the ordinary routine of factory life.
But, not so, alas! my knight of the single epaulette.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty business, sir;&rdquo; said the lieutenant, fixing a
look on me which was designed to annihilate; striding up and
down the piazza, &ldquo;a <i>very</i> pretty business, I repeat! Pray, Commodore,
Consul, Don, Se&ntilde;or, Mister, Monsieur, Theodore Canot,
or whatever the devil else you please to call yourself, how long
do you intend to keep British officers prisoners in your infernal
slave den?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg&nbsp;367]</a></span>
Now it is very likely that some years before, or if I had not
contrived the plot of this little naval <i>contre temps</i>, I might have
burst forth in a beautiful rage, and given my petulant and foiled
visitor a specimen of my Spanish vocabulary, which would not
have rested pleasantly in the memory of either party. But as <i>he</i>
warmed <i>I</i> cooled. His rage, in fact, was a fragment of my practical
satire, and I took special delight in beholding the contortions
caused by my physic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down, sit down, lieutenant!&rdquo; returned I very composedly,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re about to have coffee, and you are my <i>guest</i>. Nothing,
lieutenant, ever permits me to neglect the duties of hospitality in
such an out-of-the-way and solitary place as Africa. Sit down,
doctor! Calm yourselves, gentlemen. Take example by <i>me</i>!
Your Bonito is probably playing the devil with one of Don Pedro&rsquo;s
craft by this time; but that don&rsquo;t put me out of temper, or <i>make
me unmannerly</i> to gentlemen who honor my bamboo hut with their
presence!&rdquo; I laid peculiar stress, by way of accent, on the word
&ldquo;unmannerly,&rdquo; and in a moment I saw the field was in my hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, gentlemen,&rdquo; continued I, &ldquo;I comprehend very well both
your duty and responsibility; but, now that I see you are calmer,
have the kindness to say <i>in what</i> I am to blame? Did you not
come here to &lsquo;blockade&rsquo; New Sestros, with a brig and provisions
for half a year? And do I prevent your embarkation, if you can
find any Krooman willing to take you on board? Nay, did either
of you apprise me, as is customary when folks go visiting, that
you designed leaving my quarters at so early an hour as to afford
me the pleasure of seeing every thing in order for your accommodation?
Come now, my good fellows, New Sestros is <i>my</i> flagship,
as the Bonito is <i>yours</i>! No body stirs from this beach without
the wink from its Commodore; and I shall be much surprised to
hear such excellent disciplinarians dispute the propriety of my rule.
Nevertheless, as you feel anxious to be gone on an independent
cruise, you shall be furnished with a canoe <i>instanter</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An offer,&rdquo; interjected the surgeon, &ldquo;which it would be d&mdash;&mdash;d
nonsense to accept! Have done with your infernal sneering, Don
T&eacute;odor; strike your flag, Mr. Lieutenant; and let the darkies
bring in the breakfast!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg&nbsp;368]</a></span>
I have narrated this little anecdote to show that Spanish slavers
sometimes ventured to have a little fun with the British lion,
and that when we got him on his haunches, his month full of beef
and his fore paws in air, he was by no means the unamiable beast
he is described to be, when, in company with the <i>unicorn</i>, he

<h2>CHAPTER LIX.</h2>


<p>The balance of life vibrated considerably on the African
coast. Sometimes Mr. Bull&rsquo;s scale ascended and sometimes the
Slaver&rsquo;s. It was now the turn of the former to be exalted for a
while by way of revenge for my forced hospitality.</p>

<p>Our friends of the Bonito held on with provoking pertinacity
in front of my factory, so that I was troubled but little with company
from Cuba for several months. At last, however, it became
necessary that I should visit a neighboring colony for supplies,
and I took advantage of a Russian trader along the coast to effect
my purpose. But when we were within sight of our destination,
a British cruiser brought us to and visited the &ldquo;Galopsik.&rdquo; As
her papers were in order, and the vessel altogether untainted, I
took it for granted that Lieutenant Hill would make a short stay
and be off to his &ldquo;Saracen.&rdquo; Yet, a certain &ldquo;slave deck,&rdquo; and
an unusual quantity of water-casks, aroused the officer&rsquo;s suspicions,
so that instead of heading for our port, we were unceremoniously
favored with a prize crew, and ordered to Sierra Leone!</p>

<p>I did not venture to protest against these movements, inasmuch
as I had no interest whatever in the craft, but I ventured
to suggest that &ldquo;as I was only a <i>passenger</i>, there could be no objection
to my landing before the new voyage was commenced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means, sir,&rdquo; was the prompt reply, &ldquo;<i>your presence
is a material fact for the condemnation of the vessel</i>!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg&nbsp;370]</a></span>
Indeed, I soon found out that I was recognized by some of the Kroomen
on the cruiser, and my unlucky reputation was a hole in the
bottom of our Russian craft!</p>

<p>At Sierra Leone matters became worse. The Court did not
venture to condemn the Russian, but resolved on ordering her to
England; and when I re-stated my reasonable appeal for release,
I was told that I must accompany the vessel on her visit to Great
Britain.</p>

<p>This arbitrary decision of our captors sadly disconcerted my
plans. A voyage to England would ruin New Sestros. My <i>barracoons</i>
were alive with blacks, but I had not a month&rsquo;s provisions
in my stores. The clerk, temporarily in charge, was altogether
unfit to conduct a factory during a prolonged absence,&mdash;and all
my personal property, as well as Don Pedro&rsquo;s, was at the hazard
of his judgment during a period of considerable difficulty.</p>

<p>I resolved to take &ldquo;French leave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three men-of-war were anchored astern and on our bows. No
boats were allowed to approach us from shore; at night two marines
and four sailors paraded the deck, so that it was a thing of
some peril to dream of escape in the face of such Arguses. Yet
there was no help for it. I could not afford an Admiralty or
Chancery suit in England, while my <i>barracoons</i> were foodless in
Africa.</p>

<p>No one had been removed from the Russian since her seizure,
nor were we denied liberty of motion and intercourse so long as
suspicion had not ripened into legal condemnation. The captain,
by birth a Spaniard, was an old acquaintance, while the steward
and boatswain were good fellows who professed willingness to aid
me in any exploit I might devise for my liberty.</p>

<p>I hit upon the plan of a regular carouse; and at once decided
that my Spanish skipper was bound to keep his birthday with
commendable merriment and abundant grog. There was to be
no delay; one day was as good as another for his festival, while
all that we needed, was time enough to obtain the requisite supplies
of food and fluid.</p>

<p>This was soon accomplished, and the &ldquo;fatted pig&rdquo; slaughtered
for the feast. As I never left home unprovided with gold,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg&nbsp;371]</a></span>
means were not wanting to stock our pantry with champagne as
well as brandy.</p>

<p>Every thing went off to a charm. We fed like gluttons and
drank like old-fashioned squires. Bumper after bumper was
quaffed to the captain. Little by little, the infection spread, as it
always does, from the wardroom to the cabin, and &ldquo;goodfellowship&rdquo;
was the watchword of the night. Invitations were given
and accepted by our prize crew. Bull and the Lion again relaxed
under the spell of beef and brandy, so that by sundown every lip
had tasted our <i>eau de vie</i>, and watered for more. The &ldquo;first
watch&rdquo; found every soul on board, with the exception of our corporal
of marines, as happy as lords.</p>

<p>This corporal was a regular &ldquo;character;&rdquo; and, from the first,
had been feared as our stumbling-block. He was a perfect martinet;
a prim, precise, black-stock&rsquo;d, military, Miss Nancy. He
neither ate nor drank, neither talked nor smiled, but paraded the
deck with a grim air of iron severity, as if resolved to preserve
his own &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; if he could not control that of any one else.
I doubt very much whether her Majesty has in her service a more
dutiful loyalist than Corporal Blunt, if that excellent functionary
has not succumbed to African malaria.</p>

<p>I hoped that something would occur to melt the corporal&rsquo;s
heart during the evening, and had prepared a little vial in my
pocket, which, at least, would have given him a stirless nap of
twenty-four hours. But nothing broke the charm of his spell-bound
sobriety. There he marched, to and fro, regular as a drum
tap, hour after hour, stiff and inexorable as a ramrod!</p>

<p>But who, after the fall of Corporal Blunt, shall declare that
there is a living man free from the lures of betrayal? And
yet, he only surrendered to an enemy in disguise!</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless me, corporal,&rdquo; said our prize lieutenant, &ldquo;in the
name of all that&rsquo;s damnable, why don&rsquo;t you let out a reef or
two from those solemn cheeks of yours, and drink a bumper to
Captain Gaspard and Don T&eacute;odor? You ain&rsquo;t afraid of <i>cider</i>,
are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Cider</i>, captain?&rdquo; said the corporal, advancing to the front
and throwing up his hand with a military salute.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg&nbsp;372]</a></span>
&ldquo;Cider and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to you!&rdquo; returned the lieutenant.
&ldquo;Cider&mdash;of course, corporal; what other sort of pop can starving
wretches like us drink in Sary-loney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, lieutenant,&rdquo; said the corporal, &ldquo;if so be as how them
fizzing bottles which yonder Spanish gentleman is a-pourin&rsquo; down
is <i>only cider</i>; and if cider ain&rsquo;t agin rules after &lsquo;eight bells;&rsquo;
and if you, lieutenant, orders me to handle my glass,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
see what right I have to disobey the orders of my superior!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! blast your sermon and provisos,&rdquo; interjected the
lieutenant, filling a tumbler and handing it to the corporal, who
drained it at a draught. In a moment the empty glass was returned
to the lieutenant, who, instead of receiving it from the
subaltern, refilled the tumbler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m a thousand times obliged, lieutenant,&rdquo;
said Blunt, with his left hand to his cap, &ldquo;a thousand, thousand
times, lieutenant,&mdash;but I&rsquo;d rather take no more, if it&rsquo;s all the
same to your honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t, Blunt, by any means; the rule is universal
among gentlemen on ship and ashore, that whenever a fellow&rsquo;s
glass is filled, he must drink it to the dregs, though he may leave
a drop in the bottom to pour out on the table in honor of his
sweetheart;&mdash;so, down with the cider! And now Blunt, my boy,
that you&rsquo;ve calked your <i>first</i> nail-head, I insist upon a bumper
all round to that sweetheart you were just talking of!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Me</i>, lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i>, corporal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t talking about any sweetheart, as I remembers,
lieutenant;&mdash;&rsquo;pon the honor of a soldier, I haven&rsquo;t had no such a
thing this twenty years, since one warm summer&rsquo;s afternoon,
when Jane&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, corporal, you don&rsquo;t pretend to contradict your superior
officer, I hope. You don&rsquo;t intend to be the first man on this ship
to show a mutinous example!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! God bless me, lieutenant, the thought never entered
my brain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the third tumbler of champagne <i>did</i>, in the apple-blossom
disguise of &ldquo;<i>cider</i>;&rdquo; and, in half an hour, there wasn&rsquo;t an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg&nbsp;373]</a></span>
odder figure on deck than the poor corporal, whose vice-like stock
steadied his neck, though there was nothing that could make him
toe the plank which he pertinaciously insisted on promenading.
Blunt the immaculate, was undeniably drunk!</p>

<p>In fact,&mdash;though I say it with all possible respect for her
Majesty&rsquo;s naval officers, <i>while on duty</i>,&mdash;there was, by this time,
hardly a sober man on deck or in the cabin except myself and
the Spanish captain, who left me to engage the prize-officer in a
game of backgammon or dominoes. The crew was dozing about
the decks, or nodding over the taffrail, while my colleague, the
boatswain, prepared an oar on the forecastle to assist me in reaching
the beach.</p>

<p>It was near midnight when I stripped in my state-room,
leaving my garments in the berth, and hanging my watch over
its pillow. In a small bundle I tied a flannel shirt and a pair
of duck pantaloons, which I fastened behind my neck as I stood
on the forecastle; and then, placing the oar beneath my arm, I
glided from the bows into the quiet water.</p>

<p>The night was not only very dark, but a heavy squall of wind
and rain, accompanied by thunder, helped to conceal my escape;
and free the stream from sharks. I was not long in reaching a
native town, where a Krooman from below, who had known me
at Gallinas, was prepared for my reception and concealment.</p>

<p>Next morning, the cabin-boy, who did not find me as usual
on deck, took my coffee to the state-room, where, it was supposed,
I still rested in comfortable oblivion of last night&rsquo;s carouse.
But the bird had flown! There were my trunk, my garments,
my watch,&mdash;undisturbed as I left them when preparing for bed.
There was the linen of my couch turned down and tumbled during
repose. The inquest had no doubt of my fate:&mdash;<i>I had fallen
overboard during the night</i>, and was doubtless, by this time,
well digested in the bowels of African sharks! Folks shook
their heads with surprise when it was reported that the notorious
slaver, Canot, had fallen a victim to <i>mania &agrave; potu</i>!</p>

<p>The <i>report</i> of my death soon reached shore; the British
townsfolk believed it, but I never imagined for a moment that
the warm-hearted tar who commanded the prize had been deceived
by such false signals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg&nbsp;374]</a></span>
During eight days I remained hidden among the friendly negroes,
and from my loophole, saw the Russian vessel sail under
the Saracen&rsquo;s escort. I was not, however, neglected in my concealment
by the worthy tradesmen of the British colony, who
knew I possessed money as well as credit. This permitted me
to receive visits and make purchases for the factory, so that I
was enabled, on the eighth day, with a full equipment of all I
desired, to quit the British jurisdiction in a Portuguese vessel.</p>

<p>On our way to New Sestros, I made the skipper heave his
main-yard aback at Digby, while I embarked thirty-one &ldquo;darkies,&rdquo;
and a couple of stanch canoes with their Kroomen, to
land my human freight in case of encountering a cruiser.</p>

<p>And well was it for me that I took this precaution. Night
fell around us, dark and rainy,&mdash;the wind blowing in squalls, and
sometimes dying away altogether. It was near one o&rsquo;clock when
the watch announced two vessels on our weather bow; and, of
course, the canoes were launched, manned, filled with twenty of
the gang, and set adrift for the coast, ere our new acquaintances
could honor us with their personal attention. Ten of the slaves
still remained on board, and as it was perilous to risk them in
our own launch, we capsized it over the squad, burying the fellows
in its bowels under the lee of a sailor&rsquo;s pistol to keep them
quiet if we were searched.</p>

<p>Our lights had hardly been extinguished in cabin and binnacle,
when we heard the measured stroke of a man-of-war oar.
In a few moments more the boat was alongside, the officer on
deck, and a fruitless examination concluded. The blacks beneath
the launch were as silent as death; nothing was found to
render the &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; suspicious; and we were dismissed with a
left-handed blessing for rousing gentlemen from their bunks on
so comfortless a night. Next morning at dawn we reached New
Sestros, where my ten lubbers were landed without delay.</p>

<p>But our little comedy was not yet over. Noon had not
struck before the &ldquo;Dolphin&rdquo; cast anchor within hail of the
&ldquo;Maria,&rdquo; and made so free as to claim her for a prize! In the
darkness and confusion of shipping the twenty slaves who were
first of all despatched in canoes, one of them slipped overboard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg&nbsp;375]</a></span>
with a paddle, and sustained himself till daylight, when he was
picked up by the cruiser whose jaws we had escaped during the
night! The negro&rsquo;s story of our trick aroused the ire of her
commander, and the poor &ldquo;Maria&rdquo; was obliged to pay the forfeit
by revisiting Sierra Leone in custody of an officer.</p>

<p>There were great rejoicings on my return to New Sestros.
The coast was full of odd and contradictory stories about our
capture. When the tale of my death at Sierra Leone by drowning,
in a fit of drunkenness, was told to my patron Don Pedro,
that intelligent gentleman denied it without hesitation, because,
in the language of the law, &ldquo;<i>it proved too much</i>.&rdquo; It was <i>possible</i>,
he said, that I might have been drowned; but when they told
him I had come to my death by strong drink, they declared what
was not only improbable, but altogether out of the question.
Accordingly, he would take the liberty to discredit the entire
story, being sure that I would turn up before long.</p>

<p>But poor Prince Freeman was not so clever a judge of nature
as Don Pedro. Freeman had heard of my death; and, imbued
as he was with the superstitions of his country, nobody could
make him credit my existence till he despatched a committee to
my factory, headed by his son, to report the facts. But then, on
the instant, the valiant prince paid me a visit of congratulation.
As I held out both hands to welcome him, I saw the fellow shrink
with distrust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count your fingers!&rdquo; said Freeman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what for?&mdash;here they are&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six&mdash;seven&mdash;eight&mdash;nine&mdash;ten!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good&mdash;good!&rdquo; shouted the prince, as he clasped my digits.
&ldquo;White men tell too many lies &rsquo;bout the commodore! White
man say, John Bull catch commodore, and cut him fingers all
off, so commodore no more can &lsquo;makee book&rsquo; for makee fool of
John Bull!&rdquo; Which, being translated into English, signifies
that it was reported my fingers had been cut off by my British
captors to prevent me from writing letters by which the innocent
natives believed I so often bamboozled and deceived the cruisers
of her Majesty.</p>

<p>During my absence, a French captain, who was one of our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg&nbsp;376]</a></span>
most attentive friends, had left a donkey which he brought from
the Cape de Verds for my especial delectation, by way of an occasional
<i>promenade &agrave; cheval</i>! I at once resolved to bestow
the &ldquo;long-eared convenience&rdquo; on Freeman, not only as a type,
but a testimonial; yet, before a week was over, the unlucky
quadruped reappeared at my quarters, with a message from the
prince that it might do well enough for a bachelor like me, but
its infernal voice was enough to cause the miscarriage of an entire
harem, if not of every honest woman throughout his jurisdiction!
The superstition spread like wildfire. The women
were up in arms against the beast; and I had no rest till I got
rid of its serenades by despatching it to Monrovia, where the
dames and damsels were not afraid of donkeys of any dimensions.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LX.</h2>


<p>It was my habit to employ at New Sestros a clerk, store-keeper,
and four seamen, all of whom were whites of reliable character,
competent to aid me efficiently in the control of my <i>barracoons</i>.</p>

<p>One of these sailors died of dropsy while in my service; and,
as I write, the memory of his death flashes across my mind so
vividly, that I cannot help recording it among the characteristic
events of African coast-life.</p>

<p>Sanchez, I think, was by birth a Spaniard; at least his perfect
familiarity with the language, as well as name and appearance,
induced me to believe that the greater part of his life must
have been spent under the shield of Saint Iago. The poor fellow
was ill for a long time, but in Africa, existence is so much a
long-drawn malady, that we hardly heeded his bloated flesh or
cadaverous skin, as he sat, day after day, musket in hand, at the
gate of our barracoon. At last, however, his confinement to bed
was announced, and every remedy within our knowledge applied
for relief. This time, however, the summons was peremptory;
the sentence was final; there was no reprieve.</p>

<p>On the morning of his death, the sufferer desired me to be
called, and, sending away the African nurse and the two old comrades
who watched faithfully at his bedside, explained that he
felt his end approaching, yet could not depart without easing his
soul by <i>confession</i>!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg&nbsp;378]</a></span>
&ldquo;Here, Don T&eacute;odor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are five ounces of gold&mdash;all
I have saved in this world,&mdash;the lees of my life,&mdash;which I
want you to take care of, and when I am dead send to my sister,
who is married to &mdash;&mdash;, in Matanzas. Will you promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I promised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Don T&eacute;odor,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;I must <i>confess</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could not repress a smile as I replied,&mdash;&ldquo;But, Jos&eacute;, I am
no <i>padre</i>, you know; a <i>clerigo</i> in no part of a slave factory; I
cannot absolve your sins; and, as for my <i>prayers</i>, poor fellow,
alas! what can they do for your sins when I fear they will hardly
avail for my own!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all one, <i>mi capitan</i>&rdquo; answered the dying man; &ldquo;it
makes not the least difference, Don T&eacute;odor, if you are a clergyman
or any thing else; it is the law of our church; and when
confession is over, a man&rsquo;s soul is easier under canvas, even if
there&rsquo;s no regular <i>padre</i> at hand to loosen the ropes, and let
one&rsquo;s sins fly to the four winds of heaven. Listen,&mdash;it will be
short.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is many years since I sailed from Havana with that notorious
slaver, Miguel &mdash;&mdash;, whose murder you may have
heard of on the coast. Our vessel was in capital order for speed
as well as cargo, and we reached Cape Mount after a quick voyage.
The place, however, was so bare of slaves, that we coasted the
reefs till we learned from a Mesurado Krooman that, in less than
a month, the supply at Little Bassa would be abundant. We
shipped the savage with his boatman, and next day reached our
destination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miguel was welcomed warmly by the chiefs, who offered a
choice lot of negroes for a portion of our cargo, inviting the captain
to tarry with the rest of his merchandise and establish a
factory. He assented; our brig was sent home with a short
cargo, while I and two others landed with the captain, to aid in
the erection and defence of the requisite buildings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It did not take long to set up our bamboo houses and open
a trade, for whose supply Miguel began an intercourse with Cape
Mesurado, paying in doubloons and receiving his merchandise in
vessels manned by American blacks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg&nbsp;379]</a></span>
&ldquo;Our captain was no niggard in housekeeping. Bountiful
meals every day supplied his friends and factory. No man went
from his door hungry or dissatisfied. When the colonists came
up in their boats with goods, or walked the beach from the Cape
to our settlement, Miguel was always alert with a welcome. A
great intimacy, of course, ensued; and, among the whole crowd
of traffickers, none were higher in our chief&rsquo;s estimation than a
certain T&mdash;&mdash;, who rarely visited the <i>barracoons</i> without a
gift from Miguel, in addition to his stipulated pay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In due time the brig returned from Havana, with a cargo
of rum, tobacco, powder, and <i>a box of doubloons</i>; but she was
ordered to the Cape de Verds to change her flag. In the interval,
the Mesurado colonists picked a quarrel with the Trade-Town
chiefs, and, aided by an American vessel, under Colombian colors,
landed a division of colonial troops and destroyed the Spanish
barracoons.<a name="FNanchor_G_14" id="FNanchor_G_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_14" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The ruin of a Spanish factory could not be regarded by our
captain with any other feeling than that of resentment. Still,
he manifested his sensibility by coolness towards the colonists,
or by refraining from that <i>profitable</i> welcome to which they had
hitherto been accustomed. But the Monrovians were not to be
rebuffed by disdain. They had heard, I suppose, of the box of
doubloons, and Miguel was &lsquo;a good fellow,&rsquo; in spite of his frigidity.
They were <i>his</i> friends for ever, and all the harm that had
been done his countrymen was attributable alone to their Colombian
foes, and not to the colonists. Such were the constant
declarations of the Monrovians, as they came, singly and in
squads, to visit us after the Trade-Town plunder. T&mdash;&mdash;, in
particular, was loud in his protestations of regard; and such was
the earnestness of his manner, that Miguel, by degrees, restored
him to confidence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thus, for a while, all things went smoothly, till T&mdash;&mdash;
reached our anchorage, with several passengers in his craft,
bound, as they said, to Grand Bassa. As usual on such visits,
the whole party dined with Miguel at four in the afternoon, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg&nbsp;380]</a></span>
at six, retired towards their vessel, with a gift of provisions and
liquor for their voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About eight o&rsquo;clock, a knocking at our gates&mdash;closed invariably
at dark, according to custom&mdash;gave notice that our recent
guests had returned. They craved hospitality for the night.
They had dallied a couple of hours on the beach, with the hope
of getting off, but the surf was so perilous that no Kroomen
would venture to convey them through the breakers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such an appeal was, of course, enough for the heart of a
courteous Spaniard,&mdash;and, on the coast, you know, it is imperative.
Miguel opened the door, and, in an instant, fell dead on
the threshold, with a ball in his skull. Several guns were discharged,
and the house filled with colonists. At the moment of
attack I was busy in the <i>barracoon</i>; but, as soon as I came
forth, the assailants approached in such numbers that I leaped
the barriers and hid myself in the forest till discovered by some
friendly natives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remained with these Africans several weeks, while a canoe
was summoned from Gallinas for my rescue. From thence I
sailed to Cuba, and was the first to apprise our owners of the
piratical onslaught by which the factory had been destroyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After this, I made several successful voyages to the coast;
and, at last, sauntering one evening along the <i>paseo</i> at Havana, I
met Don Miguel&rsquo;s brother, who, after a sorrowful chat about the
tragedy, offered me a quarter-master&rsquo;s berth in a brig he was
fitting out for Africa. It was accepted on the spot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a month we were off Mesurado, and cruised for several
days from the cape to Grand Bassa, avoiding every square-rigged
vessel that loomed above the horizon. At length, we
espied a small craft beating down the coast. We bore the stranger
company for several hours, till, suddenly taking advantage
of her long tack out to sea, we gave chase and cut off her return
towards land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a fine afternoon, and the sun was yet an hour in the
sky when we intercepted the schooner. As we ran alongside, I
thought I recognized the faces of several who, in days of old,
wore familiar in our factory,&mdash;but what was my surprise, when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg&nbsp;381]</a></span>
T&mdash;&mdash; himself came to the gangway, and hailed us in
Spanish!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pointed out the miscreant to my comrade, and, in an instant,
he was in our clutches. We let the sun go down before
we contrived a proper death for the felon. His five companions,
double-ironed, were nailed beneath the hatches in the hold.
After this, we riveted the murderer, in chains, to the mainmast,
and, for better security, fastened his spread arms to the deck by
spikes through his hands. Every sail was then set on the craft,
two barrels of tar were poured over the planks, and a brand was
thrown in the midst of the combustible materials. For a while,
the schooner was held by a hawser till we saw the flames spread
from stern to cut-water, and then, with a cheer, <i>adios</i>! It was
a beautiful sight,&mdash;that <i>auto-da-f&eacute;</i>, on the sea, in the darkness!</p>

<p>&ldquo;My confession, Don T&eacute;odor, is over. From that day, I
have never been within a church or alongside a <i>padre</i>; but I
could not die without sending the gold to my sister, and begging
a mass in some parish for the rest of my soul!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I felt very conscious that I was by no means the person to
afford ghostly consolation to a dying man under such circumstances,
but while I promised to fulfil his request carefully, I
could not help inquiring whether he sincerely repented these
atrocious deeds?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes, Don T&eacute;odor, a thousand times! Many a night,
when alone on my watch at sea, or in yonder stockade, marching
up and down before the <i>barracoon</i>, I have wept like a child for
the innocent crew of that little schooner; but, as for the murderer
of <i>Don Miguel</i>&mdash;!&rdquo; He stared wildly for a minute into
my eyes&mdash;shuddered&mdash;fell back&mdash;was dead!</p>

<p>I have no doubt the outlaw&rsquo;s story contained exaggerations,
or fell from a wrecked mind that was drifting into eternity on
the current of delirium. I cannot credit his charge against the
Monrovian colonists; yet I recount the narrative as an illustration
of many a bloody scene that has stained the borders of
Africa.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXI.</h2>


<p>During my first visit to Digby, I promised my trading friends&mdash;perhaps
rather rashly&mdash;that I would either return to their settlement,
or, at least, send merchandise and a clerk to establish a
factory. This was joyous news for the traffickers, and, accordingly,
I embraced an early occasion to despatch, in charge of a
clever young sailor, such stuffs as would be likely to tickle the
negro taste.</p>

<p>There were two towns at Digby, governed by cousins who
had always lived in harmony. My mercantile venture, however,
was unhappily destined to be the apple of discord between these
relatives. The establishment of so important an institution as a
slave-factory within the jurisdiction of the younger savage, gave
umbrage to the elder. His town could boast neither of &ldquo;merchandise&rdquo;
nor a &ldquo;white man;&rdquo; there was no profitable tax to
be levied from foreign traffic; and, in a very short time, this
unlucky partiality ripened the noble kinsmen into bitter enemies.</p>

<p>It is not the habit in Africa for negroes to expend their
wrath in harmless words, so that preparations were soon made in
each settlement for defence as well as hostility. Both towns
were stockaded and carefully watched by sentinels, day and night.
At times, forays were made into each other&rsquo;s suburbs, but as the
chiefs were equally vigilant and alert, the extent of harm was the
occasional capture of women or children, as they wandered to
the forest and stream for wood and water.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg&nbsp;383]</a></span>
This dalliance, however, did not suit the ardor of my angry
favorite. After wasting a couple of months, he purchased the
aid of certain <i>bushmen</i>, headed by a notorious scoundrel named
Jen-ken, who had acquired renown for his barbarous ferocity
throughout the neighborhood. Jen-ken and his chiefs were <i>cannibals</i>,
and never trod the war-path without a pledge to return
laden with human flesh to gorge their households.</p>

<p>Several assaults were made by this savage and his <i>bushmen</i>
on the dissatisfied cousin, but as they produced no significant
results, the barbarians withdrew to the interior. A truce
ensued. Friendly proposals were made by the younger to the
elder, and again, a couple of months glided by in seeming peace.</p>

<p>Just at this time business called me to Gallinas. On my
way thither I looked in at Digby, intending to supply the displeased
chieftain with goods and an agent if I found the establishment
profitable.</p>

<p>It was sunset when I reached the beach; too late, of course,
to land my merchandise, so that I postponed furnishing both
places until the morning. As might fairly be expected, there
was abundant joy at my advent. The neglected rival was wild
with satisfaction at the report that he, too, at length was favored
with a &ldquo;white-man.&rdquo; His &ldquo;town&rdquo; immediately became a
scene of unbounded merriment. Powder was burnt without stint.
Gallons of rum were distributed to both sexes; and dancing,
smoking and carousing continued till long after midnight, when
all stole off to maudlin sleep.</p>

<p>About three in the morning, the sudden screams of women
and children aroused me from profound torpor! Shrieks were
followed by volleys of musketry. Then came a loud tattoo
of knocks at my door, and appeals from the negro chief to rise
and fly. &ldquo;The town was besieged:&mdash;the head-men were on the
point of escaping:&mdash;resistance was vain:&mdash;they had been betrayed&mdash;there
were no fighters to defend the stockade!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was opening the door to comply with this advice, when my
Kroomen, who knew the country&rsquo;s ways even better than I, dissuaded
me from departing, with the confident assurance that our
assailants were unquestionably composed of the rival townsfolk,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg&nbsp;384]</a></span>
who had only temporarily discharged the bushmen to deceive my
entertainer. The Kroo insisted that I had nothing to fear. We
might, they said, be seized and even imprisoned; but after a
brief detention, the captors would be glad enough to accept
our ransom. If we fled, we might be slaughtered by mistake.</p>

<p>I had so much confidence in the sense and fidelity of the
band that always accompanied me,&mdash;partly as boatmen and partly
as body-guard,&mdash;that I experienced very little personal alarm
when I heard the shouts as the savages rushed through the town
murdering every one they encountered. In a few moments our
own door was battered down by the barbarians, and Jen-ken,
torch in hand, made his appearance, claiming us as prisoners.</p>

<p>Of course, we submitted without resistance, for although
fully armed, the odds were so great in those ante-revolver days,
that we would have been overwhelmed by a single wave of the
infuriated crowd. The barbarian chief instantly selected our
house for his headquarters, and despatched his followers to
complete their task. Prisoner after prisoner was thrust in.
At times the heavy mash of a war club and the cry of strangling
women, gave notice that the work of death was not yet ended.
But the night of horror wore away. The gray dawn crept
through our hovel&rsquo;s bars, and all was still save the groans of
wounded captives, and the wailing of women and children.</p>

<p>By degrees, the warriors dropped in around their chieftain.
A <i>palaver-house</i>, immediately in front of my quarters, was the
general rendezvous; and scarcely a <i>bushman</i> appeared without
the body of some maimed and bleeding victim. The mangled
but living captives were tumbled on a heap in the centre, and
soon, every avenue to the square was crowded with exulting
savages. Rum was brought forth in abundance for the chiefs.
Presently, slowly approaching from a distance, I heard the
drums, horns, and war-bells; and, in less than fifteen minutes, a
procession of women, whose naked limbs were smeared with chalk
and ochre, poured into the palaver-house to join the beastly rites.
Each of these devils was armed with a knife, and bore in her
hand some cannibal trophy. Jen-ken&rsquo;s wife, a corpulent wench
of forty-five,&mdash;dragged along the ground, by a single limb, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg&nbsp;385]</a></span>
slimy corpse of an infant ripped alive from its mother&rsquo;s womb.
As her eyes met those of her husband the two fiends yelled forth
a shout of mutual joy, while the lifeless babe was tossed in the
air and caught as it descended on the point of a spear. Then
came the <i>refreshment</i>, in the shape of rum, powder, and blood,
which was quaffed by the brutes till they reeled off, with linked
hands, in a wild dance around the pile of victims. As the
women leaped and sang, the men applauded and encouraged.
Soon, the ring was broken, and, with a yell, each female leaped
on the body of a wounded prisoner and commenced the final
sacrifice with the mockery of lascivious embraces!</p>

<p>In my wanderings in African forests I have often seen the
tiger pounce upon its prey, and, with instinctive thirst, satiate
its appetite for blood and abandon the drained corpse; but these
African negresses were neither as decent nor as merciful as the
beast of the wilderness. Their malignant pleasure seemed to
consist in the invention of tortures, that would agonize but not
slay. There was a devilish spell in the tragic scene that fascinated
my eyes to the spot. A slow, lingering, tormenting mutilation
was practised on the living, as well as on the dead; and,
in every instance, the brutality of the women exceeded that of
the men. I cannot picture the hellish joy with which they passed
from body to body, digging out eyes, wrenching off lips,
tearing the ears, and slicing the flesh from the quivering bones;
while the queen of the harpies crept amid the butchery gathering
the brains from each severed skull as a <i>bonne-bouche</i> for the approaching
feast!</p>

<p>After the last victim yielded his life, it did not require long
to kindle a fire, produce the requisite utensils, and fill the air
with the odor of <i>human flesh</i>. Yet, before the various messes
were half broiled, every mouth was tearing the dainty morsels
with shouts of joy, denoting the combined satisfaction of revenge
and appetite! In the midst of this appalling scene, I heard a
fresh cry of exultation, as a pole was borne into the apartment,
on which was impaled the living body of the conquered chieftain&rsquo;s
wife. A hole was quickly dug, the stave planted and
fagots supplied; but before a fire could be kindled the wretched
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg&nbsp;386]</a></span>
woman was dead, so that the barbarians were defeated in their
hellish scheme of burning her alive.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I do not know how long these brutalities lasted, for I remember
very little after this last attempt, except that the bush men
packed in plantain leaves whatever flesh was left from the orgie,
to be conveyed to their friends in the forest. This was the
first time it had been my lot <i>to behold the most savage development
of African nature under the stimulus of war</i>. The butchery
made me sick, dizzy, paralyzed. I sank on the earth benumbed
with stupor; nor was I aroused till nightfall, when my Kroomen
bore me to the conqueror&rsquo;s town, and negotiated our redemption
for the value of twenty slaves.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>CHAPTER LXII.</h2>


<p>I hope that no one will believe I lingered a moment in Digby,
or ever dealt again with its miscreants, after the dreadful catastrophe
I have described in the last chapter. It is true that this
tragedy might never have happened within the territory of the
rival kinsmen had not the temptations of slave-trade been offered
to their passionate natures; yet the event was so characteristic,
not only of slave-war but of indigenous barbarity, that I dared
not withhold it in these sketches of my life.</p>

<p>Light was not gleaming over the tops of the forest next
morning before I was on the beach ready to embark for Gallinas.
But the moon was full, and the surf so high that my boat could
not be launched. Still, so great were my sufferings and disgust
that I resolved to depart at all hazards; and divesting myself
of my outer garments, I stepped into a native canoe with one
man only to manage it, and dashed through the breakers. Our
provisions consisted of three bottles of gin, a jug of water, and a
basket of raw cassava, while a change of raiment and my accounts
were packed in an air-tight keg. Rough as was the sea, we succeeded
in reaching the neighborhood of Gallinas early next
morning. My Spanish friends on shore soon detected me with
their excellent telescopes, by my well-known cruising dress of
red flannel shirt and Panama hat; but, instead of running to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg&nbsp;388]</a></span>
the beach with a welcome, they hoisted the black flag, which is
ever a signal of warning to slavers.</p>

<p>My Krooman at once construed the telegraphic despatch as
an intimation that the surf was impassable. Indeed, the fact
was visible enough even to an uninstructed eye, as we approached
the coast. For miles along the bar at the river&rsquo;s mouth, the
breakers towered up in tall masses, whitening the whole extent
of beach with foam. As our little canoe rose on the top of the
swell, outside the rollers, I could see my friends waving their
hats towards the southward, as if directing my movements towards
Cape Mount.</p>

<p>In my best days on the coast I often swam in perilous seasons
a far greater distance than that which intervened betwixt my boat
and the shore. My companions at Gallinas well knew my dexterity
in the water, and I could not comprehend, therefore, why they
forbade my landing, with so much earnestness. In fact, their zeal
somewhat nettled me, and I began to feel that dare-devil resistance
which often goads us to acts of madness which make us heroes if
successful, but fools if we fail.</p>

<p>It was precisely this temper that determined me to hazard the
bar; yet, as I rose on my knees to have a better view of the approaching
peril, I saw the black flag thrice lowered in token of
adieu. Immediately afterward it was again hoisted <i>over the
effigy of an enormous shark</i>!</p>

<p>In a twinkling, I understood the <i>real</i> cause of danger, which
no alacrity or courage in the water could avoid, and comprehended
that my only hope was in the open sea. A retreat to Cape
Mount was a toilsome task for my weary <i>Krooman</i>, who had been
incessantly at work for twenty-four hours. Yet, there were but
two alternatives,&mdash;either to await the subsidence of the surf, or
the arrival of some friendly vessel. In the mean time, I eat my
last morsel of cassava, while the <i>Krooman</i> stretched himself in
the bottom of the canoe,&mdash;half in the water and half in the glaring
sun,&mdash;and went comfortably to sleep.</p>

<p>I steered the boat with a paddle, as it drifted along with tide
and current, till the afternoon, when a massive pile of clouds in
the south-east gave warning of one of those tornadoes which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg&nbsp;389]</a></span>
deluge the coast of Africa in the months of March and April. A
stout punch in the Krooman&rsquo;s ribs restored him to consciousness
from his hydropathic sleep; but he shivered as he looked at the
sky and beheld a token of that greatest misfortune that can befall
a negro,&mdash;a wet skin at sea from a shower of rain.</p>

<p>We broached our last bottle to battle the chilling element.
Had we been in company with other canoes, our first duty would
have been to lash the skiffs together so as to breast the gusts and
chopping sea with more security; but as I was entirely alone, our
sole reliance was on the expert arm and incessant vigilance of
my companion.</p>

<p>I will not detain the reader by explaining the simple process
that carried us happily through the deluge. By keeping the canoe
bow on, we nobly resisted the shock of every wave, and gradually
fell back under the impulse of each undulation. Thus we held on
till the heavy clouds discharged their loads, beating down the sea
and half filling the canoe with rain water. While the Krooman
paddled and steered, I conducted the bailing, and as the African
dipper was not sufficient to keep us free, I pressed my Panama hat
into service as an extra hand.</p>

<p>These savage squalls on the African coast, at the beginning of
the rainy season, are of short duration, so that our anxiety quickly
left us to the enjoyment of soaking skins. A twist at my red
flannel relieved it of superabundant moisture, but as the negro
delighted in no covering except his flesh, an additional kiss of
the bottle was the only comfort I could bestow on his shivering
limbs.</p>

<p>This last dram was our forlorn hope, but it only created a
passing comfort, which soon went off leaving our bodies more chill
and dejected than before. My head swam with feverish emptiness.
I seemed suddenly possessed by a feeling of wild independence&mdash;seeing
nothing, fearing nothing. Presently, this died
away, and I fell back in utter helplessness, wholly benumbed.</p>

<p>I do not remember how long this stupor lasted, but I was
aroused by the Krooman with the report of a land-breeze, and a
sail which he declared to be a cruiser. It cost me considerable
effort to shake off my lethargy, nor do I know whether I would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg&nbsp;390]</a></span>
have succeeded had there not been a medical magic in the idea of
a man-of-war, which flashed athwart my mind a recollection of the
slave accounts in our keg!</p>

<p>I had hardly time to throw the implement overboard before
the craft was within hail; but instead of a cruiser she turned out
to be a slaver, destined, like myself, for Gallinas. A warm welcome
awaited me in the cabin, and a comfortable bed with plenty
of blankets restored me for a while to health, though in all likelihood
my perilous flight from Digby and its horrors, will ache
rheumatically in my limbs till the hour of my death.</p>

<p>It was well that I did not venture through the breakers on the
day that the dead shark was hoisted <i>in terrorem</i> as a telegraph.
Such was the swarm of these monsters in the surf of Gallinas,
that more than a hundred slaves had been devoured by them in
attempting a shipment a few nights before!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIII.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Don Pedro Blanco had left Gallinas,&mdash;a retired <i>millionnaire</i>!&rdquo;
When I heard this announcement at the factory, I could with
difficulty restrain the open expression of my sorrow. It confirmed
me in a desire that for some time had been strengthening
in my mind. Years rolled over my head since, first of all, I
plunged accidentally into the slave-trade. My passion for a roving
life and daring adventure was decidedly cooled. The late barbarities
inflicted on the conquered in a war of which I was the involuntary
cause, appalled me with the traffic; and humanity called
louder and louder than ever for the devotion of my remaining
days to honest industry.</p>

<p>As I sailed down the coast to restore a child to his father,&mdash;the
King of Cape Mount,&mdash;I was particularly charmed with the
bold promontory, the beautiful lake, and the lovely islands, that
are comprised in this enchanting region. When I delivered the
boy to his parent, the old man&rsquo;s gratitude knew no bounds for
his offspring&rsquo;s redemption from slavery. Every thing was tendered
for my recompense; and, as I seemed especially to enjoy the
delicious scenery of his realm, he offered me its best location as a
gift, if I desired to abandon the slave-trade and establish a <i>lawful</i>
factory.</p>

<p>I made up my mind on the spot that the day should come
when I would be lord and master of Cape Mount; and, nestling
under the lee of its splendid headland, might snap my fingers at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg&nbsp;392]</a></span>
the cruisers. Still I could not, at once, retreat from my establishment
at New Sestros. Don Pedro&rsquo;s departure was a sore disappointment,
because it left my accounts unliquidated and my release
from the trade dependent on circumstances. Nevertheless,
I resolved to risk his displeasure by quitting the factory for a
time, and visiting him at Havana after a trip to England.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>It was in the summer of 1839 that I arranged my affairs for
a long absence, and sailed for London in the schooner Gil Blas.
We had a dull passage till we reached the chops of the British
Channel, whence a smart south-wester drove us rapidly towards our
destination.</p>

<p>Nine at night was just striking from the clocks of Dover when
a bustle on deck, a tramping of feet, a confused sound of alarm,
orders, obedience and anxiety, was followed by a tremendous crash
which prostrated me on the cabin floor, whence I bounded, with a
single spring, to the deck. &ldquo;A steamer had run us down!&rdquo;
Aloft, towered a huge black wall, while the intruder&rsquo;s cut-water
pressed our tiny craft almost beneath the tide. There was no
time for deliberation. The steamer&rsquo;s headway was stopped. The
Gil Blas, like her scapegrace godfather, was in peril of sinking;
and as the wheels began to revolve and clear the steamer from
our wreck, every one scrambled in the best way he could on board
the destroyer.</p>

<p>Our reception on this occasion by the British lion was not
the most respectful or hospitable that might be imagined. In fact,
no notice was taken of us by these &ldquo;hearts of oak,&rdquo; till a clever
Irish soldier, who happened to be journeying to Dublin, invited
us to the forward cabin. Our mate, however, would not listen to
the proposal, and hastening to the quarter-deck, coarsely upbraided
the steamer&rsquo;s captain with his misconduct, and demanded suitable
accommodations for his wounded commander and passengers.</p>

<p>In a short time the captain of the Gil Blas and I were conducted
to the &ldquo;gentlemen&rsquo;s cabin,&rdquo; and as I was still clad in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg&nbsp;393]</a></span>
thin cotton undress in which I was embarking for the land of
dreams when the accident occurred, a shirt and trowsers were
handed me fresh from the slop-shop. When my native servant
appeared in the cabin, a shower of coppers greeted him from the
passengers.</p>

<p>Next morning we were landed at Cowes, and as the steward
claimed the restitution of a pair of slippers in which I had encased
my toes, I was forced to greet the loyal earth of England with
bare feet as well as uncovered head. Our sailors, however, were
better off. In the forecastle they had fallen into the hands of
Samaritans. A profusion of garments was furnished for all their
wants, while a subscription, made up among the soldiers and women,
supplied them with abundance of coin for their journey to
London.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>An economical life in Africa, and a series of rather profitable
voyages, enabled me to enjoy my wish to see London, &ldquo;above
stairs as well as below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I brought with me from Africa a body-servant named Lunes,
an active youth, whose idea of city-life and civilization had been
derived exclusively from glimpses of New Sestros and Gallinas.
I fitted him out on my arrival in London as a fashionable &ldquo;tiger,&rdquo;
with red waistcoat, corduroy smalls, blue jacket and gold band;
and trotted him after me wherever I went in search of diversion.
It may be imagined that I was vastly amused by the odd remarks
and the complete amazement, with which this savage greeted
every object of novelty or interest. After he became somewhat
acquainted with the streets of London, Lunes occasionally made
explorations on his own account, yet he seldom came back without
a tale that showed the African to have been quite as much a
curiosity to the cockneys as the cockneys were to the darkey.</p>

<p>It happened just at this time that &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; was the rage
at one of the minor theatres, and as I felt interested to know how
the personification would strike the boy, I sent him one night to
the gallery with orders to return as soon as the piece was concluded.
But the whole night passed without the appearance of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg&nbsp;394]</a></span>
my valet. Next morning I became anxious about his fate, and,
after waiting in vain till noon, I employed a reliable officer to
search for the negro, without disclosing the fact of his servitude.</p>

<p>In the course of a few hours poor Lunes was brought to me
in a most desolate condition. His clothes were in rags, and his
gold-lace gone. It appeared that &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; had outraged his
sense of African character so greatly that he could not restrain
his passion; but vented it in the choicest <i>billingsgate</i> with which
his vocabulary had been furnished in the forecastle of the &ldquo;Gil
Blas.&rdquo; His criticism of the real Jim was by no means agreeable
to the patrons of the fictitious one. In a moment there was
a row; and the result was, that Lunes after a thorough dilapidation
of his finery departed in custody of the police, more, however,
for the negro&rsquo;s protection than his chastisement.</p>

<p>The loss of his dashing waistcoat, and the sound thrashing he
received at the hands of a London mob while asserting the
dignity of his country, and a night in the station house, spoiled
my boy&rsquo;s opinion of Great Britain. I could not induce him
afterwards to stir from the house without an escort, nor would he
believe that every policeman was not specially on the watch to
apprehend him. I was so much attached to the fellow, and his
sufferings became so painful, that I resolved to send him back to
Africa; nor shall I ever forget his delight when my decision was
announced. The negro&rsquo;s joy, however, was incomprehensible to
my fellow-lodgers, and especially to the gentle dames, who could
not believe that an African, whose liberty was assured in England,
would <i>voluntarily</i> return to Africa and slavery!</p>

<p>One evening, just before his departure, Lunes was sternly
tried on this subject in my presence in the parlor, yet nothing
could make him revoke his trip to the land of palm-trees and
<i>malaria</i>. London was too cold for him;&mdash;he hated stockings;&mdash;shoes
were an abomination!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet, tell me, Lunes,&rdquo; said one of the most bewitching of
my fair friends,&mdash;&ldquo;how is it that you go home to be a slave,
when you may remain in London as a freeman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I will repeat his answer&mdash;divested of its native gibberish:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madam, I go&mdash;because I like my country best; if I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg&nbsp;395]</a></span>
am to be a slave or work, I want to do so for a true <i>Spaniard</i>.
I don&rsquo;t like this thing, Miss,&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to his shirt collar,&mdash;&ldquo;it
cuts my ears;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like this thing&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to his trowsers;
&ldquo;I like my country&rsquo;s fashion better than yours;&rdquo;&mdash;and, taking
out a large handkerchief, he gave the inquisitive dame a rapid
demonstration of African economy in concealing nakedness, by
twisting it round those portions of the human frame which
modesty is commonly in the habit of hiding!</p>

<p>There was a round of applause and a blaze of blushes at this
extemporaneous pantomime, which Lunes concluded with the
assurance that he especially loved his master, because,&mdash;&ldquo;when
he grew to be a proper man, I would give him plenty of wives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I confess that my valet&rsquo;s philanthropic audience was not
exactly prepared for this edifying culmination in favor of Africa;
but, while my friends were busy in obliterating the red and the
wrinkles from their cheeks, I took the liberty to enjoy, from
behind the shadow of my tea cup, the manifest disgust they felt
for the bad taste of poor Lunes!</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg&nbsp;396]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXIV.</h2>


<p>By this time my curiosity was not only satiated by the diversions
of the great metropolis, but I had wandered off to the country
and visited the most beautiful parts of the islands. Two months
thus slipped by delightfully in Great Britain when a sense of
duty called me to Havana; yet, before my departure, I resolved,
if possible, to secure the alliance of some opulent Englishman to
aid me in the foundation and maintenance of lawful commerce at
Cape Mount. Such a person I found in Mr. George Clavering
Redman, of London, who owned the Gil Blas, which, with two
other vessels, he employed in trade between England and Africa.</p>

<p>I had been introduced to this worthy gentleman as &ldquo;a lawful
trader on the coast,&rdquo; still, as I did not think that business relations
ought to exist between us while he was under so erroneous
an impression, I seized an early opportunity to unmask myself. At
the same time, I announced my unalterable resolution to abandon
a slaver&rsquo;s life for ever; to establish a trading post at some fortunate
location; and, while I recounted the friendship and peculiar
bonds between the king and myself, offered to purchase Cape
Mount from its African proprietor, if such an enterprise should
be deemed advisable.</p>

<p>Redman was an enterprising merchant. He heard my
proposal with interest, and, after a few days&rsquo; consideration,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg&nbsp;397]</a></span>
assented to a negotiation, as soon as I gave proofs of having
abandoned the slave traffic for ever. It was understood that no
contract was to be entered into, or document signed, till I was at
liberty to withdraw completely from Don Pedro Blanco and all
others concerned with him. This accomplished, I was to revisit
England and assume my lawful functions.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>When I landed in the beautiful Queen of the Antilles I found
Don Pedro in no humor to accede to these philanthropic notions.
The veteran slaver regarded me, no doubt, as a sort of cross
between a fool and zealot. An American vessel had been recently
chartered to carry a freight to the coast; and, accordingly, instead
of receiving a release from servitude, I was ordered on board the
craft as supercargo of the enterprise! In fact, on the third day
after my arrival at Havana, I was forced to re-embark for the
coast without a prospect of securing my independence.</p>

<p>The reader may ask why I did not burst the bond, and free
myself at a word from a commerce with which I was disgusted?
The question is <i>natural</i>&mdash;but the reply is <i>human</i>. I had too
large an unliquidated interest at New Sestros, and while it
remained so, I was not entitled to demand from my employer a
final settlement for my years of labor. In other words <i>I was in
his power</i>, so far as my means were concerned, and my services
were too valuable to be surrendered by him voluntarily.</p>

<p>A voyage of forty-two days brought me once more to New
Sestros, accompanied by a couple of negro women, who paid
their passage and were lodged very comfortably in the steerage.
The elder was about forty and extremely corpulent, while her
companion was younger as well as more comely.</p>

<p>This respectable dame, after an absence of twenty-four years,
returned to her native Gallinas, on a visit to her father, king
Shiakar. At the age of fifteen, she had been taken prisoner and
sent to Havana. A Cuban confectioner purchased the likely
girl, and, for many years, employed her in hawking his cakes and
pies. In time she became a favorite among the townsfolk, and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg&nbsp;398]</a></span>
by degrees, managed to accumulate a sufficient amount to purchase
her freedom. Years of frugality and thrift made her proprietor
of a house in the city and an egg-stall in the market,
when chance threw in her way a cousin, lately imported from
Africa, who gave her news of her father&rsquo;s family. A quarter of
a century had not extinguished the natural fire in this negro&rsquo;s
heart, and she immediately resolved to cross the Atlantic and
behold once more the savage to whom she owed her birth.</p>

<p>I sent these adventurous women to Gallinas by the earliest
trader that drifted past New Sestros, and learned that they were
welcomed among the islands with all the ceremony common
among Africans on such occasions. Several canoes were despatched
to the vessel, with flags, tom-toms, and horns, to receive
and welcome the ladies. On the shore, a procession was formed,
and a bullock offered to the captain in token of gratitude for his
attention.</p>

<p>When her elder brother was presented to the retired egg-merchant,
he extended his arms to embrace his kinswoman; but,
to the amazement of all, she drew back with a mere offer of her
hand, refusing every demonstration of affection <i>till he should
appear dressed with becoming decency</i>. This rebuke, of course,
kept the rest of her relatives at bay, for there was a sad deficiency
of trowsers in the gang, and it was the indispensable garment
that caused so unsisterly a reception.</p>

<p>But Shiakar&rsquo;s daughter, travelled as she was, could neither
set the fashions nor reform the tastes of Gallinas. After a sojourn
of ten days, she bade her kindred an eternal adieu, and
returned to Havana, disgusted with the manners and customs
of her native land.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg&nbsp;399]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXV.</h2>


<p>On my return to New Sestros, I found that the colonial authorities
of Liberia had been feeling the pulse of my African friend,
Freeman, in order to secure the co-operation of that distinguished
personage in the suppression of the slave traffic. Freeman professed
his willingness to conclude a treaty of commerce and
amity with Governor Buchanan, but respectfully declined to
molest the factories within his domain.</p>

<p>Still, Buchanan was not to be thwarted by a single refusal,
and enlisted the sympathy of an officer in command of a United
States cruiser, who accompanied the governor to the anchorage
at New Sestros. As soon as these personages reached their destination,
a note was despatched to the negro potentate, desiring
him to expel from his territory all Spaniards who were possessed
of factories. To this, it is said, the chief returned a short and
tart rebuke for the interference with his independence; whereupon
the following singular missive was immediately delivered
to the Spaniards:&mdash;</p>

<p class="address1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">U. S. Brig Dolphin</span>,</p>
<p class="address2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New Sestros</span>, <i>March 6, 1840</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir:</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I address you in consequence of having received a
note from you a few evenings since; but I wish it to be understood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg&nbsp;400]</a></span>
that this communication is intended for all or any persons
who are now in New Sestros, engaged in the slave-trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have received information that you now have, in your
establishments on shore, several hundred negroes confined in barracoons,
waiting for an opportunity to ship them. Whether you
are Americans, English, French, Spaniards, or Portuguese, you
are acting in violation of the established laws of your respective
countries, and, therefore, are not entitled to any protection from
your governments. You have placed yourselves beyond the
protection of any civilized nation, as you are engaged in a traffic
which has been made <i>piracy</i> by most of the Christian nations
of the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I have been sent by my government to root out, if possible,
this traffic on and near our settlements on the coast, I
must now give you notice, that you must break up your establishment
at this point, in two weeks from this date; failing to do
so, I shall take such measures as I conceive necessary to attain
this object. I will thank you to send a reply to this communication
immediately, stating your intentions, and also sending an
account of the number of slaves you have on hand.</p>

<p class="sig1">&ldquo;I am, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="sig2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Charles R. Bell</span>,</p>
<p class="sig3">&ldquo;<i>Lieut. Com. U. S. Naval Forces, Coast of Africa</i>.</p>

<p class="receipt1">&ldquo;To Mr. A. <span class="smcap">Demer</span> and others,</p>
<p class="receipt2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New Sestros</span>, <i>Coast of Africa</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not know what reply was made to this communication,
as a copy was not retained; but when my clerk handed me the
original letter from Lieutenant Bell, on my arrival from Cuba
I lost no time in forwarding the following answer to Col. Hicks,
at Monrovia, to be despatched by him to the American officer:</p>

<p class="receipt1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To Charles R. Bell, Esq.</span>,</p>
<p class="receipt2">&ldquo;<i>Lieut. Com. of the U. S. Forces, Coast of Africa, Monrovia</i>.</p>

<p class="address1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New Sestros</span>, <i>April 2, 1840</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir:</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Your letter of the 6th March, directed to the white
residents of New Sestros, was handed me on my return to this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg&nbsp;401]</a></span>
country, and I am sorry I can make but the following short
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First, sir, you seem to assume a supremacy over the most
civilized nations of the world, and, under the doubtful pretext
of your nation&rsquo;s authority, threaten to land and destroy our property
on these neutral shores. Next, you are pleased to inform
us that all Christian nations have declared the slave-trade
<i>piracy</i>, and that we are not entitled to any protection from our
government. Why, then, do the Southern States of your great
confederacy allow slavery, public auctions, transportation from
one State to another,&mdash;not only of civilized black native subjects,&mdash;but
of nearly white, American, Christian citizens? Such is
the case in your free and independent country; and, though the
slave-trade is carried on in the United States of America with
more brutality than in any other colony, I still hope you are a
Christian!</p>

<p>&ldquo;To your third article, wherein you observe, having &lsquo;been
sent by your government to root out this traffic, if possible, near
your own settlements on the coast,&rsquo;&mdash;allow me to have my doubts
of such orders. Your government could not have issued them
without previously making them publicly known;&mdash;and, permit
me to say, those Christian nations you are pleased to mention,
are not aware that your nation had set up colonies on the coast
of Africa. They were always led to believe that these Liberian
settlements were nothing but Christian beneficial societies,
humanely formed by private philanthropists, to found a refuge
for the poor blacks born in America, who cannot be protected in
their native country by the free and independent laws and institutions
of the United States.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If my argument cannot convince you that you are not justified
in molesting a harmless people on these desolate shores,
allow me to inform you that, should you put your threats in execution
and have the advantage over us, many factories would suffer
by your unjust attack, which would give them an indisputable
right to claim high damages from your government.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the white residents here, are, and have been,
friendly to Americans at large; some have been educated in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg&nbsp;402]</a></span>
your country, and it would be the saddest day of their lives, if
obliged to oppose by force of arms the people of a nation they
love as much as their own countrymen. The undersigned, in
particular, would wish to observe that the same spirit that led
him to avenge Governor Findley&rsquo;s murder, will support him in
defence of his property, though much against his inclination.</p>

<p class="sig1">&ldquo;I remain, very respectfully,</p>
<p class="sig2">&ldquo;Your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="sig3">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Theodore Canot</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This diplomatic encounter terminated the onslaught. Buchanan,
who was over hasty with military display on most occasions,
made a requisition for volunteers to march against
New Sestros. But the troops were never set in motion. In
the many years of my residence in the colonial neighborhood,
this was the only occasion that menaced our friendship or
verged upon hostilities.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>Whilst I was abroad in England and Cuba, my <i>charg&eacute;
d&rsquo;affaires</i> at New Sestros sent off a cargo of three hundred
negroes, nearly all of whom were safely landed in the West
Indies, bringing us a profit of nine thousand dollars. There
were, however, still one hundred and fifty in our <i>barracoons</i> to
be shipped; and, as the cargo from the Crawford was quickly
exchanged with the natives for more slaves, in two months&rsquo; time,
I found my pens surcharged with six hundred human beings.
Two other neighboring factories were also crammed; while,
unfortunately, directly in front of us, a strong reinforcement of
British men-of-war kept watch and ward to prevent our depletion.</p>

<p>No slaver dared show its topsails above the horizon. The
season did not afford us supplies from the interior. Very few
coasters looked in at New Sestros; and, as our stock of grain
and provisions began to fail, the horrors of famine became the
sole topic of conversation among our alarmed factors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg&nbsp;403]</a></span>
It will readily be supposed that every effort was made, not
only to economize our scanty stores, but to increase them
through the intervention of boats that were sent far and wide to
scour the coast for rice and cassava. Double and triple prices
were offered for these articles, yet our agents returned without
the required supplies. In fact, the free natives themselves were
in danger of starvation, and while they refused to part with
their remnants, even under the temptation of luxuries, they
sometimes sent deputations to my settlement in search of
food.</p>

<p>By degrees I yielded to the conviction that I must diminish
my mouths. First of all, I released the old and feeble from the
<i>barracoon</i>. This, for a few days, afforded ample relief; but, as
I retained only the staunchest, the remaining appetites speedily
reduced our rations to a single meal <i>per diem</i>. At last, the
steward reported, that even this allowance could be continued
for little more than a week. In twelve days, at farthest, my resources
would be utterly exhausted.</p>

<p>In this extremity I summoned a council of neighboring
chiefs, and exposing my situation, demanded their opinion as to
a fitting course on the dreaded day. I had resolved to retain my
blacks till the last measure was distributed, and then to liberate
them to shift for themselves.</p>

<p>But the idea of releasing six hundred famishing foemen
struck the beach people with horror. It would, they said, be a
certain source of war and murder; and they implored me not
to take such a step till they made every effort to ease my burden.
As a beginning, they proposed at once relieving the <i>barracoon</i>
of a large portion of females and of all the male youths,
who were to be fed and guarded by them, on my account, till
better times.</p>

<p>By this system of colonizing I got rid of the support of two
hundred and twenty-five negroes; and, as good luck would have
it, a visit from a friendly coaster enabled me, within ten days,
to exchange my beautiful cutter &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo; for a cargo of rice from
the colony at Cape Palmas.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that in a week after this happy relief the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg&nbsp;404]</a></span>
British cruisers left our anchorage for a few days. No sooner
were they off, than a telegraph of smoke, which, in those days,
was quite as useful on the African coast, as the electric is on
ours, gave notice to the notorious &ldquo;Volador.&rdquo; There was joy
in the teeming factories when her signal was descried in the
offing; and, before the following dawn, seven hundred and forty-nine
human beings, packed within her one hundred and sixty-five
tons, were on their way to Cuba.</p>

<p><i>This was the last cargo of slaves I ever shipped!</i></p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVI.</h2>


<p>When the thought struck me of abandoning the slave-trade, and
I had resolved to follow out the good impulse, I established a
store in the neighborhood of my old <i>barracoons</i> with the design
of trafficking in the produce of industry alone. This concern
was intrusted to the management of a clever young colonist.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the British brig of war Termagant
held New Sestros in permanent blockade, forbidding even
a friendly boat to communicate with my factory. Early one
morning I was called to witness a sturdy chase between my scolding
foe and a small sail which was evidently running for the shore
in order to save her crew by beaching. The British bull-dog,
however, was not to be deterred by the perils of the surf; and,
holding on with the tenacity of fate, pursued the stranger, till
he discovered that a large reinforcement of armed natives was
arrayed on the strand ready to protect the fugitives. Accordingly,
the Englishmen refrained from assailing the mariners,
and confined their revenge to the destruction of the craft.</p>

<p>As this affray occurred within gun-shot of my lawful factory,
I hastened to the beach under the belief that some of my <i>employ&eacute;s</i>
had unluckily fallen into a difficulty with the natives. But
on my arrival I was greeted by a well-known emissary from our
headquarters at Gallinas, who bore a missive imparting the Volador&rsquo;s
arrival in Cuba with six hundred and eleven of her people.
The letter furthermore apprised me that Don Pedro, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg&nbsp;406]</a></span>
persisted in sending merchandise to my slave factory, still declined
my resignation as his agent, but acknowledged a credit in his
chest of thirteen thousand dollars for my commissions on the
Volador&rsquo;s slaves. Here, then, were Confidence and Temptation,
both resolutely proffered to lure me back to my ancient habits!</p>

<p>I was busily engaged on the sands, enforcing from the
negroes a restitution of clothes to the plundered postman, when
the crack of a cannon, higher up the beach, made me fear that an
aggression was being committed against my homestead. Before
I could depart, however, two more shots in the same quarter,
left me no room to doubt that the Termagant was talking most
shrewishly with my factory at New Sestros.</p>

<p>I reached the establishment with all convenient speed, only
to find it full of natives, who had been brought to the spot from
the interior by the sound of a cannonade. The following letter
from the captain of the man-of-war, it seems, had been landed in
a fishing canoe very soon after my departure in the morning, and
the shots, I suppose, were discharged to awake my attention
to its contents.</p>

<p class="address1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Her Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s Ship Termagant</span>,</p>
<p class="address2">&ldquo;<i>Off</i> <span class="smcap">New Sestros</span>, <i>Nov. 5, 1840</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir:</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The natives or Kroomen of your settlement having
this day fired on the boats of Her B. M. ship under my command,
while in chase of a Spanish boat with seven men going to
New Sestros, I therefore demand the persons who fired on the
boats, to answer for the same; and, should this demand not be
complied with, I shall take such steps as I deem proper to secure
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have addressed you on this occasion, judging by the
interference of those blacks in your behalf, that they are instigated
by you.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 8em;">&ldquo;I have the honor to be, sir, your obed&rsquo;t serv&rsquo;t,</p>

<p class="sig1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">H. F. Seagram</span>,</p>
<p class="sig2">&ldquo;<i>Lieut. Com.</i></p>

<p class="receipt1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To Mr. T. Canot</span>,</p>
<p class="receipt2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">New Sestros.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg&nbsp;407]</a></span>
When this cartel fell into my hands it lacked but an hour of
sunset. The beach was alive with angry rollers, while the Termagant
was still under easy sail, hovering up and down the coast
before my factory, evidently meditating the propriety of another
pill to provoke my notice.</p>

<p>I sat down at once and wrote a sort of model response, promising
to come on board bodily next morning to satisfy the lieutenant
of my innocence; but when I inquired for a Mercury to
bear my message, there was not a Krooman to be found willing to
face either the surf or the British sailor. Accordingly, there was
no alternative but to suffer my bamboo <i>barracoons</i> and factory to
be blown about my ears by the English vixen, or to face the
danger, in person, and become the bearer of my own message.</p>

<p>The proposal sounded oddly enough in the ears of the Kroomen,
who, in spite of their acquaintance with my hardihood,
could scarcely believe I would thrust my head into the very
jaws of the lion. Still, they had so much confidence in the
judgment displayed by white men on the coast, that I had little
difficulty in engaging the boat and services of a couple of sturdy
chaps; and, stripping to my drawers, so as to be ready to swim
in the last emergency, I committed myself to their care.</p>

<p>We passed the dangerous surf in safety, and in a quarter of an
hour were alongside the Termagant, whose jolly lieutenant could
not help laughing at the drenched <i>uniform</i> in which I saluted
him at the gangway. Slaver as I was, he did not deny me the
rites of hospitality. Dry raiment and a consoling glass were
speedily supplied; and with the reassured stamina of my improved
condition, it may readily be supposed I was not long in
satisfying the worthy Mr. Seagram that I had no concern in the
encounter betwixt the natives and his boats. To clinch the argument
I assured the lieutenant that I was not only guiltless of
the assault, <i>but had made up my mind irrevocably to abandon
the slave-trade</i>!</p>

<p>I suppose there was as much rejoicing that night on board
the Termagant over the redeemed slaver, as there is in most
churches over a rescued sinner. It was altogether too late and
too dark for me to repeat the perils of the surf and sharks, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg&nbsp;408]</a></span>
that I willingly accepted the offer of a bed, and promised to accompany
Seagram in the morning to the prince.</p>

<p>Loud were the shouts of amazement and fear when the negroes
saw me landing next day, side by side, in pleasant chat,
with an officer, who, eighteen hours before, had been busy about
my destruction. It was beyond their comprehension how an
Englishman could visit my factory under such circumstances, nor
could they divine how I escaped, after my voluntary surrender on
board a cruiser. When the prince saw Seagram seated familiarly
under my verandah, he swore that I must have some powerful
<i>fetiche</i> or <i>juju</i> to compel the confidence of enemies; but his
wonder became unbounded when the officer proposed his entire
abandonment of the slave-trade, <i>and I supported the lieutenant&rsquo;s
proposal</i>!</p>

<p>I have hardly ever seen a man of any hue or character, so
sorely perplexed as our African was by this singular suggestion. To
stop the slave-trade, unless by compulsion, was, in his eyes, the
absolute abandonment of a natural appetite or function. At first,
he believed we were joking. It was inconceivable that I, who for
years had carried on the traffic so adroitly, could be serious in the
idea. For half an hour the puzzled negro walked up and down the
verandah, muttering to himself, stopping, looking at both of us,
hesitating, and laughing,&mdash;till at last, as he afterwards confessed,
he concluded that I was only &ldquo;<i>deceiving the Englishman</i>,&rdquo;
and came forward with an offer to sign a treaty on the spot for
the extinction of the traffic.</p>

<p>Now the reader must bear in mind that I allowed the prince
to mislead himself through his natural duplicity on this occasion,
as I was thereby enabled to bring him again in contact with Seagram,
and secure the support of British officers for my own
purposes.</p>

<p>In a few days the deed was done. The slave-trade at New
Sestros was formally and for ever abolished by the prince and
myself. As I was the principal mover in the affair, I voluntarily
surrendered to the British officer on the day of signature, one
hundred slaves; <i>in return for which I was guarantied the safe
removal of my valuable merchandise, and property from the
settlement.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg&nbsp;409]</a></span>
It was a very short time after I had made all snug at New
Sestros that misfortune fell suddenly on our parent nest at Gallinas.
The Hon. Joseph Denman, who was senior officer of the
British squadron on the coast, unexpectedly landed two hundred
men, and burnt or destroyed all the Spanish factories amid the
lagunes and islets. By this uncalculated act of violence, the natives
of the neighborhood were enabled to gorge themselves with
property that was valued, I understand, at a very large sum.
An event like this could not escape general notice along the
African coast, and in a few days I began to hear it rumored and
discussed among the savages in <i>my</i> vicinity.</p>

<p>For a while it was still a mystery why <i>I</i> escaped while Gallinas
fell; but at length the sluggish mind of Prince Freeman began
to understand my diplomacy, and, of course, to repent the
sudden contract that deprived him of a right to rob me. Vexed
by disappointment, the scoundrel assembled his minor chiefs,
and named a day during which he knew the Termagant would be
absent, to plunder and punish me for my interference with the
welfare and &ldquo;institutions&rdquo; of his country. The hostile meeting
took place without my knowledge, though it was disclosed to all
my domestics, whose silence the prince had purchased. Indeed,
I would have been completely surprised and cut off, <i>had it not
been for the friendly warning of the negro whose life I had
saved from the saucy-wood ordeal</i>.</p>

<p>I still maintained in my service five white men, and four sailors
who were wrecked on the coast and awaited a passage home.
With this party and a few household negroes on whom reliance
might be placed, I resolved at once to defend my quarters. My
cannons were loaded, guards placed, muskets and cartridges distributed,
and even the domestics supplied with weapons; yet,
on the very night after the warning, every slave abandoned my
premises, while even Lunes himself,&mdash;the companion of my journey
to London, and pet of the ladies,&mdash;decamped with my favorite
fowling-piece.</p>

<p>When I went my rounds next morning, I was somewhat disheartened
by appearances; but my spirits were quickly restored
by the following letter from Seagram:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg&nbsp;410]</a></span></p>

<p class="address1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Her B. M. Brig Termagant, off Trade-town</span>,</p>
<p class="address2">&ldquo;<i>23d January, 1841</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,</p>

<p>&ldquo;In your letter of yesterday, you request protection for your
property, and inform me that you are in danger from the princes.
I regret, indeed, that such should be the case, more especially as
they have pledged me their words, and signed a &lsquo;<i>book</i>&rsquo; to the
effect that they would never again engage in the slave traffic.
But, <i>as I find you have acted in good faith since I commenced
to treat with you on the subject</i>, I shall afford you every assistance
in my power, and will land an armed party of twenty men
before daylight on Monday.</p>

<p class="sig1">&ldquo;I am, Sir, your obt. servt.,</p>
<p class="sig2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">H. F. Seagram</span>, Lieut. Com&rsquo;g.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Termagant&rsquo;s unlooked-for return somewhat dismayed the
prince and his ragamuffins, though he had contrived to assemble
quite two thousand men about my premises. Towards noon,
however, there were evident signs of impatience for the expected
booty; still, a wholesome dread of my cannon and small-arms,
together with the cruiser&rsquo;s presence, prevented an open attack.
After a while I perceived an attempt to set my stockade on fire,
and as a conflagration would have given a superb opportunity to
rob, I made the concerted signal for our British ally. In a twinkling,
three of the cruiser&rsquo;s boats landed an officer with twenty-five
musketeers, and before the savages could make the slightest
show of resistance, I was safe under the bayonets of Saint
George!</p>

<p>It is needless to set forth the details of my rescue. The prince
and his poltroons were panic struck; and in three or four days
my large stock of powder and merchandise was embarked without
loss for Monrovia.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg&nbsp;411]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVII.</h2>


<p>My <i>barracoons</i> and trading establishments were now totally destroyed,
and I was once more afloat in the world. It immediately
occurred to me that no opportunity would, perhaps, be
more favorable to carry out my original designs upon Cape
Mount, and when I sounded Seagram on the subject, he was not
only willing to carry me there in his cruiser, but desired to witness
my treaty with the prince for a cession of territory.</p>

<p>Our adieus to New Sestros were not very painful, and on the
evening of the same day the Termagant hove to off the bold and
beautiful hills of Cape Mount. As the breeze and sun sank together,
leaving a brilliant sky in the west, we descried from deck
a couple of tall, raking masts relieved like cobwebs against the
azure. From aloft, still more of the craft was visible, and
from our lieutenant&rsquo;s report after a glance through his glass,
there could be no doubt that the stranger was a slaver.</p>

<p>Light as was the breeze, not a moment elapsed before the
cruiser&rsquo;s jib was turned towards her natural enemy. For a while
an ebb from the river and the faint night wind off shore, forced
us seaward, yet at daylight we had gained so little on the chase,
that she was still full seven miles distant.</p>

<p>They who are familiar with naval life will appreciate the annoying
suspense on the Termagant when dawn revealed the calm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg&nbsp;412]</a></span>
sea, quiet sky, and tempting but unapproachable prize. The
well-known <i>pluck</i> of our British tars was fired by the alluring
vision, and nothing was heard about decks but prayers for a puff
and whistling for a breeze. Meanwhile, Seagram, the surgeon,
and purser were huddled together on the quarter, cursing a calm
which deprived them of prize-money if not of promotion. Our
master&rsquo;s mate and passed midshipman were absent in some of the
brig&rsquo;s boats cruising off Gallinas or watching the roadstead of
New Sestros.</p>

<p>The trance continued till after breakfast, when our officers&rsquo;
impatience could no longer withstand the bait, and, though short
of efficient boats, the yawl and lieutenant&rsquo;s gig were manned for
a hazardous enterprise. The former was crammed with six sailors,
two marines, and a supernumerary mate; while the gig, a
mere fancy craft, was packed with five seamen and four marines
under Seagram himself. Just as this flotilla shoved off, a rough
boatswain begged leave to fit out my nutshell of a native canoe;
and embarking with a couple of Kroomen, he squatted amidships,
armed with a musket and cutlass!</p>

<p>This expedition exhausted our stock of <i>nautical</i> men so completely,
that as Seagram crossed the gangway he commended the
purser and surgeon to <i>my care, and left Her Majesty&rsquo;s brig in
charge of the reformed slaver</i>!</p>

<p>No sooner did the chase perceive our man&oelig;uvre, than, running
in her sweeps, she hoisted a Spanish flag and fired a warning
cartridge. A faint hurrah answered the challenge, while our
argonauts kept on their way, till, from deck, they became lost
below the horizon. Presently, however, the boom of another
gun, followed by repeated discharges, rolled through the quiet
air from the Spaniard, and the look-out aloft reported our boats
in retreat. Just at this moment, a light breeze gave headway to
the Termagant, so that I was enabled to steer towards the prize,
but before I could overhaul our warriors, the enemy had received
the freshening gale, and, under every stitch of canvas, stood
rapidly to sea.</p>

<p>When Seagram regained his deck, he was bleeding profusely
from a wound in the head received from a handspike while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg&nbsp;413]</a></span>
attempting to board. Besides this, two men were missing, while
three had been seriously wounded by a shot that sunk the yawl.
My gallant boatswain, however, returned unharmed, and, if I may
believe the commander of the &ldquo;Serea,&rdquo;&mdash;whom I encountered
some time after,&mdash;this daring sailor did more execution with his
musket than all the marines put together. The <i>Kroo</i> canoe
dashed alongside with the velocity of her class, and, as a petty
officer on the Spaniard bent over to sink the skiff with a ponderous
top-block, our boatswain cleft his skull with a musket ball,
and brought home the block as a trophy! In fact, Seagram confessed
that the Spaniard behaved magnanimously; for the moment
our yawl was sunk, Olivares cut adrift his boat, and bade the
struggling swimmers return in it to their vessel.</p>

<p>I have described this little affray not so much for its interest,
but because it illustrates the vicissitudes of coast-life and the rapidity
of their occurrence. Here was I, on the deck of a British
man-of-war, in charge of her man&oelig;uvres while in chase of a Spaniard,
who, for aught I knew, might have been consigned to me
for slaves! I gave my word to Seagram as he embarked, to
manage his ship, and had I attained a position that would have
enabled me to sink the &ldquo;Serea,&rdquo; I would not have shrunk from
my duty. Yet it afforded me infinite satisfaction to see the
chase escape, for my heart smote me at taking arms against men
who had probably broken bread at my board.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg&nbsp;414]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII.</h2>


<p>Next day we recovered our anchorage opposite Cape Mount, and
wound our way eight or ten miles up the river to the town of
Toso, which was honored with the residence of King Fana-Toro.
It did not require long to satisfy his majesty of the benefits
to be derived from my plan. The news of the destruction
of Gallinas, and of the voluntary surrender of my quarters at
New Sestros, had spread like wildfire along the coast; so that
when the African princes began to understand they were no
longer to profit by unlawful traffic, they were willing enough not
to lose <i>all</i> their ancient avails, by compromising for a <i>legal</i> commerce,
under the sanction of national flags. I explained my projects
to Fana-Toro in the fullest manner, offering him the most
liberal terms. My propositions were forcibly supported by Prince
Gray; and a cession of the Mount and its neighboring territory
was finally made, under a stipulation that the purchase-money
should be paid in presence of the negro&rsquo;s council, and the surrender
of title witnessed by the Termagant&rsquo;s officers.<a name="FNanchor_8_15" id="FNanchor_8_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_15" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg&nbsp;415]</a></span>
As soon as the contract was fully signed, sealed, and delivered,
making Mr. Redman and myself proprietors, in fee-simple,
of this beautiful region, I hastened in company with my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg&nbsp;416]</a></span>
naval friends to explore my little principality for a suitable town-site.
We launched our boat on the waters of the noble lake
Plitzogee at Toso, and after steering north-eastwardly for two hours
under the pilotage of Prince Gray, entered a winding creek and
penetrated its thickets of mangrove and palm, till the savage
landed us on decayed steps and pavement made of <i>English
brick</i>. At a short distance through the underwood, our conductor
pointed out a denuded space which had once served as
the foundation of an <i>English slave factory</i>; and when my companions
hesitated to believe the prince&rsquo;s dishonorable charge on
their nation, the negro confirmed it by pointing out, deeply carved
in the bark of a neighboring tree, the name of:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">T. WILLIAMS,<br />
1804.<br /></p>

<p>I took the liberty to compliment Seagram and the surgeon on
the result of our exploration; and, after a hearty laugh at the
denouement of the prince&rsquo;s search for a <i>lawful</i> homestead, we
plunged still deeper in the forest, but returned without finding a
location to my taste. Next day we recommenced our exploration
by land, and, in order to obtain a comprehensive view of my
dominion, as far as the eye would reach, I proposed an ascent of
the promontory of the Cape which lifts its head quite twelve hundred
feet above the sea. A toilsome walk of hours brought us
to the summit, but so dense was the foliage and so lofty the magnificent
trees, that, even by climbing the tallest, my scope of
vision was hardly increased. As we descended the slopes, however,
towards the strait between the sea and lake, I suddenly
came upon a rich, spacious level, flanked by a large brook of
delicious water, and deciding instantly that it was an admirable
spot for intercourse with the ocean as well as interior, I resolved
that it should be the site of my future home. A tar was
at hand to climb the loftiest palm, to strip its bushy head, and
hoist the union-jack. Before sundown, I had taken solemn territorial
possession, and baptized the future town &ldquo;New Florence,&rdquo;
in honor of my Italian birthplace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg&nbsp;417]</a></span>
My next effort was to procure laborers, for whom I invoked
the aid of Fana-Toro and the neighboring chiefs. During two
days, forty negroes, whom I hired for their food and a <i>per diem</i>
of twenty cents, wrought faithfully under my direction; but the
constant task of felling trees, digging roots, and clearing ground,
was so unusual for savages, that the entire gang, with the exception
of a dozen, took their pay in rum and tobacco and quitted me.
A couple of days more, devoted to such endurance, drove off the
remaining twelve, so that on the fifth day of my philanthropic enterprise
I was left in my solitary hut with a single attendant. I
had, alas! undertaken a task altogether unsuited to people whose
idea of earthly happiness and duty is divided between palm-oil,
concubinage, and sunshine!</p>

<p>I found it idle to remonstrate with the king about the indolence
of his subjects. Fana-Toro entertained very nearly the
same opinion as his slaves. He declared,&mdash;and perhaps very
sensibly,&mdash;that white men were fools to work from sunrise to sunset
every day of their lives; nor could he comprehend how negroes
were expected to follow their example; nay, it was not the
&ldquo;fashion of Africa;&rdquo; and, least of all, could his majesty conceive
how a man possessed of so much merchandise and property, would
voluntarily undergo the toils I was preparing for the future!</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s censure and surprise were not encouraging; yet
I had so long endured the natural indolence of negrodom, that I
hardly expected either a different reply or influential support, from
his majesty. Nevertheless, I was not disheartened. I remembered
the old school-boy maxim, <i>non vi sed s&aelig;pe cadendo</i>,
and determined to effect by degrees what I could not achieve at a
bound. For a while I tried the effect of higher wages; but an
increase of rum, tobacco, and coin, could not string the nerves or
cord the muscles of Africa. Four men&rsquo;s labor was not equivalent
to one day&rsquo;s work in Europe or America. The negro&rsquo;s philosophy
was both natural and self-evident:&mdash;<i>why should he work
for pay when he could live without it?&mdash;labor could not give
him more sunshine, palm-oil, or wives; and, as for grog and
tobacco, they might be had without the infringement of habits
which had almost the sacredness of religious institutions.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg&nbsp;418]</a></span>
With such slender prospects of prosperity at New Florence, I
left a man in charge of my hut, and directing him to get on as well
as he could, I visited Monrovia, to look after the merchandise
that had been saved from the wreck of New Sestros.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIX.</h2>


<p>I might fairly be accused of ingratitude if I passed without notice
the Colony of Liberia and its capital, whose hospitable doors
were opened widely to receive an exile, when the barbarians of
New Sestros drove me from that settlement.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to tire the reader with an account of
Liberia, for I presume that few are unacquainted with the thriving
condition of those philanthropic lodgments, which hem the
western coast of Africa for near eight hundred miles.</p>

<p>In my former visits to Monrovia, I had been regarded as a
dangerous intruder, who was to be kept for ever under the vigilant
eyes of government officials. When my character as an established
slaver was clearly ascertained, the port was interdicted to my
vessels, and my appearance in the town itself prohibited. Now,
however, when I came as a fugitive from violence, and with the
acknowledged relinquishment of my ancient traffic, every hand
was extended in friendship and commiseration. The governor
and council allowed the landing of my rescued slave-goods on
deposit, while the only two servants who continued faithful were
secured to me as apprentices by the court. Scarcely more than
two months ago, the people of this quiet village were disturbed
from sleep by the roll of drums beating for recruits to march
against &ldquo;<i>the slaver Canot</i>;&rdquo; to-day I dine with the chief of the
colony and am welcomed as a brother! This is another of those
remarkable vicissitudes that abound in this work, and which the
critics, in all likelihood, may consider too often repeated. To
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg&nbsp;420]</a></span>
my mind, however, it is only another illustration of the probability
of the odd and the strangeness of <i>truth</i>!</p>

<p>I had no difficulty in finding all sorts of workmen in Monrovia,
for the colonists brought with them all the mechanical ingenuity
and thrift that characterize the American people. In four months,
with the assistance of a few carpenters, sawyers and blacksmiths,
I built a charming little craft of twenty-five tons, which, in honor
of my British protector, I dubbed the &ldquo;Termagant.&rdquo; I notice
the construction of this vessel, merely to show that the colony
and its people were long ago capable of producing every thing that
may be required by a commercial state in the tropics. When my
cutter touched the water, she was indebted to foreign countries
for nothing but her copper, chains and sails, every thing else being
the product of Africa and <i>colonial</i> labor. Had nature bestowed
a better harbor on the Mesurado river, and afforded a safer entrance
for large vessels, Monrovia would now be second only to
Sierra Leone. Following the beautiful border of the Saint Paul&rsquo;s,
a few miles from Monrovia the eye rests on extensive plains teeming
with luxurious vegetation. The amplest proof has been given
of the soil&rsquo;s fertility in the production of coffee, sugar, cotton and
rice. I have frequently seen cane fourteen feet high, and as thick
as any I ever met with in the Indies. Coffee-trees grow much
larger than on this side of the Atlantic; single trees often yielding
sixteen pounds, which is about seven more than the average
product in the West Indies.<a name="FNanchor_H_16" id="FNanchor_H_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_16" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> Throughout the entire jurisdiction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg&nbsp;421]</a></span>
between Cape Mount and Cape Palmas, to the St. Andrew&rsquo;s, the
soil is equally prolific. Oranges, lemons, cocoanuts, pine-apples,
mangoes, plums, granadillas, sour and sweet sop, plantains, bananas,
guyavas, tamarinds, ginger, sweet potatoes, yams, cassava,
and corn, are found in abundance; while the industry of American
settlers has lately added the bread-fruit, rose apple, patanga,
cantelope, water-melon, aguacate and mulberry. Garden culture
produces every thing that may be desired at the most luxurious
table.</p>

<p>Much has been said of the &ldquo;pestilential climate of Africa,&rdquo;
and the certain doom of those who venture within the spell of its
miasma. I dare not deny that the coast is scourged by dangerous
maladies, and that nearly all who take up their abode in the
colonies are obliged to undergo the ordeal of a fever which assails
them with more or less virulence, according to the health, constitution,
or condition of the patient. Yet I think, if the colonization
records are read with a candid spirit, they will satisfy unprejudiced
persons that the mortality of emigrants has diminished nearly
one half, in consequence of the sanitary care exercised by the colonial
authorities during the period of acclimation. The colonies
are now amply supplied with lodgings for new comers, where every
thing demanded for comfort, cure, or alleviation, is at hand in
abundance. Colored physicians, who studied their art in America,
have acquainted themselves with the local distempers, and proved
their skill by successful practice. Nor is there now the difficulty
or expense which, twelve years ago, before the destruction of the
neighboring slave marts, made it almost impossible to furnish
convalescents with that delicate nourishment which was needed
to re-establish their vigor.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>It may not be amiss if I venture to hope that these colonial
experiments, which have been fostered for the civilization of Africa
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg&nbsp;422]</a></span>
as well as for the amelioration of the American negro&rsquo;s lot, will
continue to receive the support of all good men. Some persons
assert that the race is incapable of self-government beyond the
tribal state, and <i>then</i> only through fear; while others allege, that
no matter what care may be bestowed on African intellect, it is
unable to produce or sustain the highest results of modern civilization.
It would not be proper for any one to speak oracularly
on this mooted point; yet, in justice to the negroes who never left
their forests, as well as to those who have imbibed, for more than
a generation, the civilization of Europe or America, I may unhesitatingly
say, that the colonial trial has thus far been highly promising.
I have often been present at difficult councils and &ldquo;<i>palavers</i>&rdquo;
among the <i>wild</i> tribes, when questions arose which demanded
a calm and skilful judgment, and in almost every instance, the
decision was characterized by remarkable good sense and equity.
In most of the <i>colonies</i> the men who are intrusted with local control,
a few years since were either slaves in America, or employed
in menial tasks which it was almost hopeless they could escape.
Liberia, at present, may boast of several individuals, who, but for
their caste, might adorn society; while they who have personally
known Roberts, Lewis, Benedict, J. B. McGill, Teage, Benson of
Grand Bassa, and Dr. McGill of Cape Palmas, can bear testimony
that nature has endowed numbers of the colored race with the best
qualities of humanity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the prosperity, endurance and influence of the
colonies, are still problems. I am anxious to see the second generation
of the colonists in Africa. I wish to know what will be
the force and development of the negro mind on its native soil,&mdash;civilized,
but cut off from all instruction, influence, or association
with the white mind. I desire to understand, precisely, whether
the negro&rsquo;s faculties are original or imitative, and consequently,
whether he can stand alone in absolute independence, or is only
respectable when reflecting a civilization that is cast on him by
others.</p>

<p>If the descendants of the present colonists, increased by an
immense immigration <i>of all classes and qualities</i> during the next
twenty-five years, shall sustain the young nation with that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg&nbsp;423]</a></span>
industrial energy and political dignity that mark its population in
our day, we shall hail the realized fact with infinite delight.
We will rejoice, not only because the emancipated negro may
thenceforth possess a realm wherein his rights shall be sacred,
but because the civilization with which the colonies must border
the African continent, will, year by year, sink deeper and deeper
into the heart of the interior, till barbarism and Islamism will
fade before the light of Christianity.</p>

<p>But the test and trial have yet to come. The colonist of our
time is an exotic under glass,&mdash;full, as yet, of sap and stamina
drawn from his native America, but nursed with care and exhibited
as the efflorescence of modern philanthropy. Let us hope
that this wholesome guardianship will not be too soon or suddenly
withdrawn by the parent societies; but that, while the state of
pupilage shall not be continued till the immigrants and their
children are emasculated by lengthened dependence, it will be
upheld until the republic shall exhibit such signs of manhood as
cannot deceive the least hopeful.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_H_16" id="Footnote_H_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_16"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> I wish to confirm and fortify this statement in regard to the value of
coffee culture in the colonies, by the observation of Dr. J. W. Lugenbeel,
late colonial physician and United States agent in Liberia. The Doctor
gave &ldquo;particular attention to observations and investigations respecting
coffee culture in Liberia.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have frequently seen,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;isolated
trees growing in different parts of Liberia, which yielded from ten to twenty
pounds of clean dry coffee at one picking; and, however incredible it
may appear, it is a fact that one tree in Monrovia yielded four and a half
bushels of coffee in the hull, at one time, which, when dried and shelled,
weighed thirty-one pounds. This is the largest quantity I ever heard of,
and the largest tree I ever saw, being upwards of twenty feet high and of
proportionate dimensions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Doctor is of opinion, however, that as the coffee-tree begins to bear
at the end of its fourth year, an <i>average</i> yield at the end of the sixth year
may be calculated on of at least four pounds. Three hundred trees may
be planted on an acre, giving each twelve feet, and in six years the culture
will become profitable as well as easy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXX.</h2>


<p>I returned to Cape Mount from the colony with several American
mechanics and a fresh assortment of merchandise for traffic
with the natives. During my absence, the agent I left in charge
had contrived, with great labor, to clear a large space in the
forest for my projected establishment, so that with the aid of my
Americans, I was soon enabled to give the finishing touch to
New Florence. While the buildings were erecting, I induced a
number of natives, by force of double pay and the authority of
their chiefs, to form and cultivate a garden, comprising the
luxuries of Europe and America as well as of the tropics, which,
in after days, secured the admiration of many a naval commander.</p>

<p>As soon as my dwelling was nicely completed, I removed my
furniture from the colony; and, still continuing to drum through
the country for business with the Africans, I despatched my
Kroomen and pilots on board of every cruiser that appeared in the
offing, to supply them with provisions and refreshments.</p>

<p>An event took place about this time which may illustrate the
manner in which a branch of the slave-trade is carried on along
the coast. Her Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s sloop of war L&mdash;&mdash; was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg&nbsp;425]</a></span>
in the neighborhood, and landed three of her officers at my
quarters to spend a day or two in hunting the wild boars with
which the adjacent country was stocked. But the rain poured
down in such torrents, that, instead of a hunt, I proposed a
dinner to my jovial visitors. Soon after our soup had been despatched
on the piazza, there was a rush of natives into the yard,
and I was informed that one of our Bush chiefs had brought in a
noted gambler, whom he threatened either to sell or kill.</p>

<p>It struck me instantly that this would be a good opportunity
to give my British friends a sight of native character, at the
same time that they might be enabled, if so disposed, to do a
generous action. Accordingly, I directed my servant to bring
the Bushman and gambler before us; and as the naked victim,
with a rope round his neck, was dragged by the savage to our
table, I perceived that it was Soma, who had formerly been in
my service on the coast. The vagabond was an excellent interpreter
and connected with the king, but I had been obliged to discharge
him in consequence of his dissipated habits, and especially
for having gambled away his youngest sister, whose release from
Gallinas I had been instrumental in securing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought Soma to your store-keeper,&rdquo; said the Bushman,
&ldquo;and I want him to buy the varlet. Soma has been half
the day gambling with me. First of all he lost his gun, then his
cap, then his cloth, then his right leg, then his left, then his arms,
and, last of all, his head. I have given his friends a chance to
redeem the dog, but as they had bought him half a dozen times
already, there&rsquo;s not a man in the town that will touch him.
Soma <i>never</i> pays his debts; and now, Don T&eacute;odore, I have
brought him here, and if <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t buy him, I&rsquo;ll take him to the
water-side and <i>cut his throat</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There,&mdash;with an imploring countenance, bare as he came into
the world, a choking cord round his throat, and with pinioned
arms,&mdash;stood the trembling gambler, as I glanced in vain from
the Bushman to the officers, in expectation of his release by those
philanthropists! As Soma spoke English, I told him in our
language, that I had no pity for his fate, and that he must take
the chances he had invoked. Twenty dollars would have saved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg&nbsp;426]</a></span>
his life, and yet the British did not melt! &ldquo;Take him off,&rdquo;
said I sternly, to the Bushman, &ldquo;and use him as you choose!&rdquo;&mdash;but
at the same moment, a wink to my interpreter sufficed, and
the Bushman returned to the forest with tobacco and rum, while
Soma was saved from slaughter. It is by no means improbable
that the gambler is now playing <i>monte</i> on some plantation in
Cuba.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I continued my labors at New Florence without intermission
for several months, but when I cast up my account, I found the
wages and cost of building so enormous, that my finances would
soon be exhausted. Accordingly, by the advice of my friend
Seagram, as well as of Captain Tucker, who commanded on the
station, I petitioned Lord Stanley to grant me one hundred recaptured
Africans to till my grounds and learn the rudiments of
agricultural industry. Some time elapsed before an answer was
sent, but when it came, my prospects were dashed to the earth.</p>

<p class="address1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Government House, Sierra Leone</span>,</p>
<p class="address2">&ldquo;<i>28th October, 1843</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir:</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated
August last, inclosing the copy of a petition, the original of
which you had transmitted to the acting Lieutenant Governor
Ferguson, for the purpose of having it forwarded to her Majesty&rsquo;s
Government.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In reply, I have to acquaint you, that by the receipt of a
despatch from the Rt. Hon. Lord Stanley, Secretary of State for
the Colonies, bearing date 8th April 1842, his Lordship states
that he cannot sanction a compliance with your request to have a
number of liberated Africans, as apprentices, in tilling your
grounds; and further, that he could not recognize the purchase
of Cape Mount, as placing that district under the protection and
sovereignty of the British crown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg to add, that I am glad to be informed by Captain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg&nbsp;427]</a></span>
Oake that the vessel, alluded to in your letter, which you had
been unable to despatch for want of a license, had obtained one for
that purpose from the governor of Monrovia.</p>

<p class="sig1">&ldquo;I am, sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p class="sig2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">G. Mac Donald</span>,</p>
<p class="sig3">&ldquo;<i>Governor</i>.</p>

<p class="receipt1">&ldquo;<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Theodore Canot</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The picture that had been painted by my imagination with so
many bright scenes and philanthropic hopes, fell as I finished this
epistle. It not only clouded my future prospects of lawful commerce,
but broke off, at once, the correspondence with my generous
friend Redman in London. As I dropped the missive on the
table, I ordered the palm-tree on which I had first unfurled the
British flag to be cut down; and next day, on a tall pole, in full
view of the harbor, I hoisted a tri-colored banner, adorned by a
central star, which I caused to be baptized, in presence of
Fana-Toro, with a salvo of twenty guns.</p>

<p>I am not naturally of a mischievous or revengeful temper, but
I can scarcely find language to express the mortification I experienced
when Lord Stanley thwarted my honest intentions, by
his refusal to protect the purchase whereon I had firmly resolved
to be an ally and friend, in concentrating a lawful commerce. I
was especially disgusted by this mistrust, or mistake, after the
flattering assurances with which my design had, from the first,
been cherished by the British officers on the station. I may confess
that, for a moment, I almost repented the confidence I had
reposed in the British lion, and was at a loss whether to abandon
Cape Mount and return to my former traffic, or to till the ground
and play waterman to the fleet.</p>

<p>After proper deliberation, however, I resolved to take the
plough for my device; and before Christmas, I had already
ordered from England a large supply of agricultural implements
and of every thing requisite for elaborate husbandry. After this,
I purchased forty youths to be employed on a coffee plantation,
and to drag my ploughs till I obtained animals to replace them.
In a short time I had abundance of land cleared, and an over-seer&rsquo;s
house erected for an old barracoonier, who, I am grieved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg&nbsp;428]</a></span>
to say, turned out but a sorry farmer. He had no idea of systematic
labor or discipline save by the lash, so that in a month, four
of his gang were on the sick list, and five had deserted. I replaced
the Spaniard by an American colored man, who, in turn,
made too free with my people and neglected the plantations.
My own knowledge of agriculture was so limited, that unless I
fortified every enterprise by constant reference to books, I was
unable to direct my hands with skill; and, accordingly, with all
these mishaps to my commerce and tillage, I became satisfied
that it was easier to plough the ocean than the land.</p>

<p>Still I was not disheartened. My trade, on a large scale,
with the interior, and my agriculture had both failed; yet I resolved
to try the effect of traffic in a humble way, combined with
such <i>mechanical</i> pursuits as would be profitable on the coast.
Accordingly, I divided a gang of forty well-drilled negroes into
two sections, retaining the least intelligent on the farm, while the
brighter youths were brought to the landing. Here I laid out
a ship-yard, blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, and sawpit, placing at the head of
each, a Monrovian colonist to instruct my slaves. In the mean
time the neighboring natives, as well as the people some distance
in the interior, were apprised by my runners of the new factory
I was forming at Cape Mount.</p>

<p>By the return of the dry season our establishment gave signs
of renewed vitality. Within the fences of New Florence there
were already twenty-five buildings and a population of one hundred,
and nothing was wanting but a stock of cattle, which I soon
procured from the Kroo country.</p>

<p>Thus, for a long time all things went on satisfactorily, not only
with the natives, but with foreign traders and cruisers, till a native
war embarrassed my enterprise, and brought me in contact
with the enemies of King Fana-Toro, of whose realm and deportment
I must give some account.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg&nbsp;429]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXI.</h2>


<p>The Africans who cluster about the bold headland of Cape
Mount,&mdash;which, in fair weather, greets the mariner full thirty
miles at sea,&mdash;belong to the Vey tribe, and are in no way inferior
to the best classes of natives along the coast. Forty or fifty
families constitute &ldquo;a town,&rdquo; the government of which is generally
in the hands of the oldest man, who administers justice by
a &ldquo;palaver&rdquo; held in public, wherein the seniors of the settlement
are alone consulted. These villages subject themselves voluntarily
to the protectorate of larger towns, whose chief arbitrates
as sovereign without appeal in all disputes among towns
under his wardship; yet, as his judgments are not always pleasing,
the dissatisfied desert their huts, and, emigrating to another
jurisdiction, build their village anew within its limits.</p>

<p>The Veys of both sexes are well-built, erect, and somewhat
stately. Their faith differs but little from that prevalent among
the Soosoos of the Rio Pongo. They believe in a superior power
that may be successfully invoked through <i>gree-grees</i> and <i>fetiches</i>,
but which is generally obstinate or mischievous. It is their idea
that the good are rewarded after death by transformation into
some favorite animal; yet their entire creed is not subject to any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg&nbsp;430]</a></span>
definite description, for they blend the absurdities of Mahometanism
with those of paganism, and mellow the whole by an acknowledgment
of a supreme deity.</p>

<p>The Vey, like other <i>uncontaminated</i> Ethiopians, is brought
up in savage neglect by his parents, crawling in perfect nakedness
about the villages, till imitation teaches him the use of raiment,
which, in all likelihood, he first of all obtains by theft.
There is no difference between the sexes during their early
years. A sense of shame or modesty seems altogether unknown
or disregarded; nor is it unusual to find ten or a dozen
of both genders huddled promiscuously beneath a roof whose
walls are not more than fifteen feet square.</p>

<p>True to his nature, a Vey bushman rises in the morning to
swallow his rice and cassava, and crawls back to his mat which is
invariably placed in the sunshine, where he <i>simmers</i> till noontide,
when another wife serves him with a second meal. The remainder
of daylight is passed either in gossip or a second <i>siesta</i>,
till, at sundown, his other wives wash his body, furnish a third
meal, and stretch his wearied limbs before a blazing fire to refresh
for the toils of the succeeding day. In fact, the slaves of a
household, together with its females, form the entire working
class of Africa, and in order to indoctrinate the gentler sex in its
future toils and duties, there seems to be a sort of national seminary
which is known as the Gree-gree-bush.</p>

<p>The Gree-gree-bush is a secluded spot or grove of considerable
extent in the forest, apart from dwellings and cultivated land
though adjacent to villages, which is considered as consecrated
ground and forbidden to the approach of men. The establishment
within this precinct consists of a few houses, with an extensive
area for exercise. It is governed chiefly by an old woman of
superior skill and knowledge, to whose charge the girls of a village
are intrusted as soon as they reach the age of ten or twelve.
There are various opinions of the use and value of this institution
in the primitive polity of Africa. By some writers it is
treated as a religious cloister for the protection of female chastity,
while by others it is regarded as a school of licentiousness.
From my own examination of the establishment, I am quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg&nbsp;431]</a></span>
satisfied that a line drawn between these extremes will, most probably,
characterize the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; with accuracy, and that what was
originally a conservative seclusion, has degenerated greatly under
the lust of tropical passions.</p>

<p>As the procession of novices who are about to enter the
grove approaches the sanctuary, music and dancing are heard
and seen on every side. As soon as the maidens are received,
they are taken by the <i>gree-gree</i> women to a neighboring stream,
where they are washed, and undergo an operation which is regarded
as a sort of circumcision. Anointed from head to foot
with palm-oil, they are next reconducted to their home in the
gree-gree bush. Here, under strict watch, they are maintained
by their relatives or those who are in treaty for them as wives,
until they reach the age of puberty. At this epoch the important
fact is announced by the gree-gree woman to the purchaser
or future husband, who, it is expected, will soon prepare to
take her from the retreat. Whenever his <i>new</i> house is ready for
the bride&rsquo;s reception, it is proclaimed by the ringing of bells and
vociferous cries during night. Next day search is made by females
through the woods, to ascertain whether intruders are lurking
about, but when the path is ascertained to be clear, the girl
is forthwith borne to a rivulet, where she is washed, anointed,
and clad in her best attire. From thence she is borne, amid
singing, drumming, shouting, and firing, in the arms of her female
attendants, till her unsoiled feet are deposited on the husband&rsquo;s
floor.<a name="FNanchor_9_17" id="FNanchor_9_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_17" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>I believe this institution exists throughout a large portion of
Africa, and such is the desire to place females within the bush,
that poor parents who cannot pay the initiatory fee, raise subscriptions
among their friends to obtain the requisite slave whose
gift entitles their child to admission. Sometimes, it is said, that
this <i>human ticket is stolen</i> to effect the desired purpose, and
that no native power can recover the lost slave when once within
the sacred precincts.</p>

<p>The gree-gree-bush is not only a resort of the virgin, but of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg&nbsp;432]</a></span>
the wife, in those seasons when approaching maternity indicates
need of repose and care. In a few hours, the robust mother
issues with her new-born child, and after a plunge into the nearest
brook, returns to the domestic drudgery which I have
already described.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>In the time of Fana-Toro, Toso was the royal residence where
his majesty played sovereign and protector over six towns and
fifteen villages. His government was generally considered patriarchal.
When I bought Cape Mount, the king numbered
&ldquo;seventy-seven rains,&rdquo; equivalent to so many years;&mdash;he was
small, wiry, meagre, erect, and proud of the respect he universally
commanded. His youth was notorious among the tribes for intrepidity,
and I found that he retained towards enemies a bitter
resentment that often led to the commission of atrocious cruelties.</p>

<p>It was not long after my instalment at the Cape, that I accidentally
witnessed the ferocity of this chief. Some trifling
&ldquo;country affair&rdquo; caused me to visit the king; but upon landing at
Toso I was told he was abroad. The manner of my informant,
however, satisfied me that the message was untrue; and accordingly,
with the usual confidence of a &ldquo;white man&rdquo; in Africa, I
searched his premises till I encountered him in the &ldquo;palaver-house.&rdquo;
The large inclosure was crammed with a mob of savages,
all in perfect silence around the king, who, in an infuriate
manner, with a bloody, knife in his hand, and a foot on the dead
body of a negro, was addressing the carcass. By his side stood
a pot of hissing oil, in which the heart of his enemy was frying!</p>

<p>My sudden and, perhaps, improper entrance, seemed to exasperate
the infidel, who, calling me to his side, knelt on the
corpse, and digging it repeatedly with his knife, exclaimed with
trembling passion, that it was his bitterest and oldest foe&rsquo;s! For
twenty years he had butchered his people, sold his subjects, violated
his daughters, slain his sons, and burnt his towns;&mdash;and
with each charge, the savage enforced his assertion by a stab.</p>

<p>I learned that the slaughtered captive was too brave and
wary to be taken alive in open conflict. He had been kidnapped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg&nbsp;433]</a></span>
by treachery, and as he could not be forced to walk to Toso, the
king&rsquo;s trappers had cooped him in a huge basket, which they
bore on their shoulders to the Cape. No sooner was the brute in
his captor&rsquo;s presence, than he broke a silence of three days by
imprecations on Fana-Toro. In a short space, his fate was decided
in the scene I had witnessed, while his body was immediately
burnt to prevent it from taking the form of some ferocious
beast which might vex the remaining years of his royal executioner!</p>

<p>This was the only instance of Fana-Toro&rsquo;s barbarity that
came under my notice, and in its perpetration he merely followed
the example of his ancestors in obedience to African ferocity.
Yet, of his intrepidity and nobler endurance, I will relate an
anecdote which was told me by reliable persons. Some twenty
years before my arrival at the Cape, large bands of mercenary
bushmen had joined his enemies along the beach, and after desolating
his territory, sat down to beleaguer the stockade of Toso.
For many a day thirst and hunger were quietly suffered under
the resolute command of the king, but at length, when their
pangs became unendurable, and the people demanded a surrender,
Fana-Toro strode into the &ldquo;palaver-house,&rdquo; commanding a
<i>sortie</i> with his famished madmen. The warriors protested
against the idea, for their ammunition was exhausted. Then
arose a wild shout for the king&rsquo;s deposition and the election of a
chief to succeed him. A candidate was instantly found and installed;
but no sooner had he been chosen, than Fana-Toro,&mdash;daring
the new prince to prove a power of <i>endurance</i> equal to
his own,&mdash;plunged his finger in a bowl of boiling oil, and held it
over the fire, without moving a muscle, till the flesh was crisped
to the bone.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the sovereign was at once
restored to his rights, or that, availing himself of the fresh enthusiasm,
he rushed upon his besiegers, broke their lines, routed the
mercenaries, and compelled his rival to sue for peace. Until
the day of his death, that mutilated hand was the boast of his
people.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg&nbsp;434]</a></span>
The Vey people mark with some ceremony the extremes of
human existence&mdash;birth and death. Both events are honored
with feasting, drinking, dancing, and firing; and the descendants
of the dead sometimes impoverish, and even ruin themselves, to
inter a venerable parent with pomp.</p>

<p>Prince Gray, the son of Fana-Toro, whom I have already
mentioned, died during my occupation of Cape Mount. I was at
Mesurado when the event happened, but, as soon as I heard it,
I resolved to unite with his relations in the last rites to his
memory. Gray was not only a good negro and kind neighbor,
but, as my fast friend in &ldquo;country matters,&rdquo; his death was a
personal calamity.</p>

<p>The breath was hardly out of the prince&rsquo;s body, when his
sons, who owned but little property and had no slaves for sale,
hastened to my agent, and pledged their town of Panama for
means to defray his funeral. In the mean time, the corpse,
swathed in twenty large country sheets, and wrapped in twenty
pieces of variegated calico, was laid out in a hut, where it
was constantly watched and <i>smoked</i> by three of the favorite
widows.</p>

<p>After two months devotion to moaning and <i>seasoning</i>, notice
was sent forty miles round the country, summoning the tribes
to the final ceremony. On the appointed day the corpse was
brought from the hut, <i>a perfect mass of bacon</i>. As the procession
moved towards the palaver-house, the prince&rsquo;s twenty
wives&mdash;almost entirely denuded, their heads shaved, and their
bodies smeared with dust&mdash;were seen following his remains.
The eldest spouse appeared covered with self-inflicted bruises,
burns, and gashes&mdash;all indications of sorrow and future uselessness.</p>

<p>The crowd reached the apartment, singing the praises of the
defunct in chorus, when the body was laid on a new mat, covered
with his war shirt, while the parched lump that indicated his
head was crowned with the remains of a fur hat. All the amulets,
charms, gree-grees, fetiches and flummery of the prince were
duly bestowed at his sides. While these arrangements were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg&nbsp;435]</a></span>
making within, his sons stood beneath an adjoining verandah,
to receive the condolences of the invited guests, who, according
to custom, made their bows and deposited a tribute of rice,
palm-oil, palm-wine, or other luxuries, to help out the merry-making.</p>

<p>When I heard of the prince&rsquo;s death at Monrovia, I resolved
not to return without a testimonial of respect for my ally, and
ordered an enormous coffin to be prepared without delay. In
due time the huge chest was made ready, covered with blue cotton,
studded with brass nails, and adorned with all the gilded
ornaments I could find in Monrovia. Besides this splendid
sarcophagus, my craft from the colony was ballasted with four
bullocks and several barrels of rum, as a contribution to the
funeral.</p>

<p>I had timed my arrival at Fanama, so as to reach the landing
about ten o&rsquo;clock on the morning of burial; and, after a salute
from my brazen guns, I landed the bullocks, liquor, and coffin,
and marched toward the princely gates.</p>

<p>The unexpected appearance of the white friend of their
father, lord, and husband, was greeted by the family with a loud
wail, and, as a mark of respect, I was instantly lifted in the arms
of the weeping women, and deposited on the mat beside the
corpse. Here I rested, amid cries and lamentations, till near
noon, when the bullocks were slaughtered, and their blood offered
in wash-bowls to the dead. As soon as this was over, the shapeless
mass was stowed in the coffin without regard to position, and
borne by six carriers to the beach, where it was buried in a cluster
of cotton-woods.</p>

<p>On our return to Fanama from the grave, the eldest son of
the deceased was instantly saluted as prince. From this moment
the festivities began, and, at sundown, the twenty widows reappeared
upon the ground, clad in their choicest raiment, their
shaven skulls anointed with oil, and their limbs loaded with every
bead and bracelet they could muster. Then began the partition
of these disconsolate relicts among the royal family. Six were
selected by the new prince, who divided thirteen among his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg&nbsp;436]</a></span>
brothers and kinsmen, but gave his mother to his father-in-law.
As soon as the allotment was over, his highness very courteously
offered me the choice of his <i>six</i>, in return for my gifts; but as I
never formed a family tie with natives, I declined the honor, as
altogether too overwhelming!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXXII.</h2>


<p>When I was once comfortably installed at my motley establishment,
and, under the management of Colonists, had initiated the
native workmen into tolerable skill with the adze, saw, sledgehammer
and forge, I undertook to build a brig of one hundred
tons. In six months, people came from far and near to behold
the mechanical marvels of Cape Mount. Meanwhile, my
plantation went on slowly, while my <i>garden</i> became a matter of
curiosity to all the intelligent coasters and cruisers, though I
could never enlighten the natives as to the value of the &ldquo;foreign
grass&rdquo; which I cultivated so diligently. They admired the symmetry
of my beds, the richness of my pine-apples, the luxurious
splendor of my sugar-cane, the abundance of my coffee, and the
cool fragrance of the arbors with which I adorned the lawn; but
they would never admit the use of my exotic vegetables. In
order to water my premises, I turned the channel of a brook,
surrounding the garden with a perfect canal; and, as its sides
were completely laced with an elaborate wicker-work of willows,
the aged king and crowds of his followers came to look upon the
Samsonian task as one of the wonders of Africa. &ldquo;What is it,&rdquo;
exclaimed Fana-Toro, as he beheld the deflected water-course,
&ldquo;that a white man cannot do!&rdquo; After this, his majesty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg&nbsp;438]</a></span>
inspected all my plants, and shouted again with surprise at the toil
we underwent to satisfy our appetites. The use or worth of
<i>flowers</i>, of which I had a rare and beautiful supply, he could
never divine; but his chief amazement was still devoted to our
daily expenditure of time, strength, and systematic toil, when
rice and palm-oil would grow wild while we were sleeping!</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>It will be seen from this sketch of my domestic comforts and
employment, that New Florence prospered in every thing but
<i>farming</i> and <i>trade</i>. At first it was my hope, that two or three
years of perseverance would enable me to open a lawful traffic
with the interior; but I soon discovered that the slave-trade was
alone thought of by the natives, who only bring the neighboring
produce to the beach, when their captives are ready for
a market. I came, moreover, to the conclusion that the interior
negroes about Cape Mount had no commerce with Eastern tribes
except for slaves, and consequently that its small river will
never create marts like those which have direct communications
by water with the heart of a rich region, and absorb its gold,
ivory, wax, and hides. To meet these difficulties, I hastened the
building of my vessel <i>as a coaster</i>.</p>

<p>About this time, an American craft called the A&mdash;&mdash;, arrived
in my neighborhood. She was loaded with tobacco, calicoes,
rum, and powder. Her captain who was unskilled in coast-trade,
and ignorant of Spanish, engaged me to act as supercargo for him
to Gallinas. In a very short period I disposed of his entire
investment. The trim and saucy rig of this Yankee clipper bewitched
the heart of a Spanish trader who happened to be among
the <i>lagunes</i>, and an offer was forthwith made, through me, for
her purchase. The bid was accepted at once, and the day before
Christmas fixed as the period of her delivery, after a trip to the
Gaboon.</p>

<p>In contracting to furnish this slaver with a craft and the
necessary apparatus for his cargo, it would be folly for me to
deny that I was dipping once more into my ancient trade; yet,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg&nbsp;439]</a></span>
on reflection, I concluded that in covering the vessel for a moment
with my name, I was no more amenable to rebuke, than the
respectable merchants of Sierra Leone and elsewhere who passed
hardly a day without selling, to notorious slavers, such merchandise
as could be used <i>alone</i> in slave-wars or slave-trade. It is
probable that the sophism soothed my conscience at the moment,
though I could never escape the promise that sealed my agreement
with Lieutenant Seagram.</p>

<p>The appointed day arrived, and my smoking semaphores
announced the brigantine&rsquo;s approach to Sugarei, three miles from
Cape Mount. The same evening the vessel was surrendered to
me by the American captain, who landed his crew and handed
over his flag and papers. As soon as I was in charge, no delay
was made to prepare for the reception of freight; and by sunrise
I resigned her to the Spaniard, who immediately embarked seven
hundred negroes, and landed them in Cuba in twenty-seven days.</p>

<p>Till now the British cruisers had made Cape Mount their
friendly rendezvous, but the noise of this shipment in my neighborhood,
and my refusal to explain or converse on the subject, gave
umbrage to officers who had never failed to supply themselves
from my grounds and larder. In fact I was soon marked as an
enemy of the squadron, while our intercourse dwindled to the
merest shadow. In the course of a week, the Commander on the
African station, himself, hove to off the Cape, and summoning me
on board, concluded a petulant conversation by remarking that &ldquo;a
couple of men like Monsieur Canot would make work enough in
Africa for the whole British squadron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I answered the compliment with a profound <i>salaam</i>, and went
over the Penelope&rsquo;s side satisfied that my friendship was at an
end with her Majesty&rsquo;s cruisers.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>The portion of Cape Mount whereon I pitched my tent, had
been so long depopulated by the early wars against Fana-Toro,
that the wild beasts reasserted their original dominion over the
territory. The forest was full of leopards, wild cats, cavallis or
wild boars, and ourang-outangs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg&nbsp;440]</a></span>
Very soon after my arrival, a native youth in my employ had
been severely chastised for misconduct, and in fear of repetition,
fled to the mount after supplying himself with a basket of cassava.
As his food was sufficient for a couple of days, we thought he
might linger in the wood till the roots were exhausted, and then
return to duty. But three days elapsed without tidings from
the truant. On the fourth, a diligent search disclosed his corpse
in the forest, every limb dislocated and covered with bites apparently
made by human teeth. It was the opinion of the natives
that the child had been killed by ourang-outangs, nor can I doubt
their correctness, for when I visited the scene of the murder,
the earth for a large space around, was covered with the footprints
of the beast and scattered with the skins of its favorite
esculent.</p>

<p>I was more annoyed, however, at first, by leopards than
any other animal. My cattle could not stray beyond the fences,
nor could my laborers venture abroad at any time without
weapons. I made use of spring-traps, pit-fall, and various expedients
to purify the forest; but such was the cunning or agility
of our nimble foes that they all escaped. The only mode by
which I succeeded in freeing the <i>homestead</i> of their ravages, was
by arming the muzzle of a musket with a slice of meat which
was attached by a string to the trigger, so that the load and the
food were discharged into the leopard&rsquo;s mouth at the same moment.
Thus, by degrees as my settlement grew, the beasts receded from
the promontory and its adjacent grounds; and in a couple of
years, the herds were able to roam where they pleased without
danger.</p>

<p>Cape Mount had long been deserted by elephants, but about
forty miles from my dwelling, on the upper forests of the lake,
the noble animal might still be hunted; and whenever the natives
were fortunate enough to &ldquo;bag&rdquo; a specimen, I was sure to be
remembered in its division. If the prize proved a male, I received
the feet and trunk, but if it turned out of the gentler
gender, I was honored with the udder, as a royal <i>bonne-bouche</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<span class="caption">AN ELEPHANT HUNT.</span>
</div>

<p>In Africa a slaughtered elephant is considered public property
by the neighboring villagers, all of whom have a right to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg&nbsp;441]</a></span>
carve the giant till his bones are bare. A genuine sportsman
claims nothing but the ivory and tail, the latter being universally
a perquisite of the king. Yet I frequently found that associations
were made among the natives to capture this colossal beast
and his valuable tusks. Upon these occasions, a club was formed
on the basis of a whaling cruise, while a single but well-known
hunter was chosen to do execution. One man furnished the
muskets, another supplied the powder, a third gave the iron bolts
for balls, a fourth made ready the provender, while a fifth despatched
a bearer with the armament. As soon as the outfit was
completed, the huntsman&rsquo;s <i>juju</i> and <i>fetiche</i> were invoked for
good luck, and he departed under an escort of wives and associates.</p>

<p>An African elephant is smaller, as well as more cunning and
wild, than the Asiatic. Accordingly, the sportsman is often
obliged to circumvent his game during several days, for it is said
that in populous districts, its instincts are so keen as to afford
warning of the neighborhood of fire-arms, even at extraordinary
distances. The common and most effectual mode of enticing an
elephant within reach of a ball, is to strew the forest for several
miles with <i>pine-apples</i>, whose flavor and fragrance infallibly bewitch
him. By degrees, he tracks and nibbles the fruit from
slice to slice, till, lured within the hunter&rsquo;s retreat, he is despatched
from the branches of a lofty tree by repeated shots at
his capacious forehead.</p>

<p>Sometimes it happens that four or five discharges with the
wretched powder used in Africa fail to slay the beast, who escapes
from the jungle and dies afar from the encounter. When this
occurs, an attendant is despatched for a reinforcement, and I have
seen a whole settlement go forth <i>en masse</i> to search for the
monster that will furnish food for many a day. Sometimes the
crowd is disappointed, for the wounds have been slight and the
animal is seen no more. Occasionally, a dying elephant will
linger a long time, and is only discovered by the buzzards hovering
above his body. Then it is that the bushmen, guided by
the vultures, haste to the forest, and fall upon the putrid flesh with
more avidity than birds of prey. Battles have been fought on
the carcass of an elephant, and many a slave, captured in the
conflict, has been marched from the body to the beach.</p>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg&nbsp;442]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER LXXIII.</h2>


<p>The war, whose rupture I mentioned at the end of the seventieth
chapter, spread rapidly throughout our borders; and absorbing
the entire attention of the tribe, gave an impulse to slavery
which had been unwitnessed since my advent to the Cape.
The reader may readily appreciate the difficulty of my position
in a country, hemmed in by war which could only be terminated
by slaughter or slavery. Nor could I remain neutral in New
Florence, which was situated on the same side of the river as
Toso, while the enemies of Fana-Toro were in complete possession
of the opposite bank.</p>

<p>When I felt that the rupture between the British and myself
was not only complete but irreparable, I had less difficulty in
deciding my policy as to the natives; and, chiefly under the impulse
of self-protection, I resolved to serve the cause of my
ancient ally. I made whatever fortifications could be easily defended
in case of attack, and, by way of show, mounted some
cannon on a boat which was paraded about the waters in a formidable
way. My judgment taught me from the outset that it was
folly to think of joining actively in the conflict; for, while I had
but three white men in my quarters, and the colonists had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg&nbsp;443]</a></span>
returned to Monrovia, my New Sestros experience taught me the
value of bondsmen&rsquo;s backing.</p>

<p>Numerous engagements and captures took place by both
parties, so that my doors were daily besieged by a crowd of
wretches sent by Fana-Toro to be purchased <i>for shipment</i>. I
declined the contract with firmness and constancy, but so importunate
was the chief that I could not resist his desire that a
Spanish factor might come within my limits with merchandise
from Gallinas to purchase his prisoners. &ldquo;He could do nothing
with his foes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when in his grasp, but slay or sell them.&rdquo;
The king&rsquo;s enemy, on the opposite shore, disposed of his captives to
Gallinas, and obtained supplies of powder and ball, while Fana-Toro,
who had no vent for his prisoners, would have been destroyed
without my assistance.</p>

<p>Matters continued in this way for nearly two years, during
which the British kept up so vigilant a blockade at Cape Mount
and Gallinas, that the slavers had rarely a chance to enter a vessel
or run a cargo. In time, the <i>barracoons</i> became so gorged,
that the slavers began to build their own schooners. When the
A&mdash;&mdash; was sold, I managed to retain her long-boat in my service,
but such was now the value of every egg-shell on the coast,
that her owner despatched a carpenter from Gallinas, who, in a
few days, decked, rigged, and equipped her for sea. She was
twenty-three feet long, four feet deep, and five feet beam, so that,
when afloat, her measurement could not have exceeded four tons.
Yet, on a dark and stormy night, she dropped down the river,
and floated out to sea through the besieging lines, with thirty-three
black boys, two sailors, and a navigator. In less than
forty days she transported the whole of her living freight across
the Atlantic to Bahia. The negroes almost perished from thirst,
but the daring example was successfully followed during the succeeding
year, by skiffs of similar dimensions.</p>

<hr style="width: 30%;" />

<p>I can hardly hope that a narrative of my dull routine, while
I lingered on the coast, entirely aloof from the slave-trade, would
either interest or instruct the general reader. The checkered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg&nbsp;444]</a></span>
career I have already exposed, has portrayed almost every phase
of African life. If I am conscious of any thing during my domicile
at Cape Mount, it is of a sincere desire to prosper by lawful
and honorable thrift. But, between the native wars, the turmoil
of intruding slavers, and the suspicions of the English, every
thing went wrong. The friendship of the colonists at Cape
Palmas and Monrovia was still unabated; appeals were made
by missionaries for my influence with the tribes; coasters called
on me as usual for supplies; yet, with all these encouragements
for exertion, I must confess that my experiment was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. I lost my cutter, laden with stores and
merchandise for my factory. A vessel, filled with rice and lumber
for my ship-yard, was captured <i>on suspicion</i>, and, though
sent across the Atlantic for adjudication, was dismissed uncondemned.
The sudden death of a British captain from Sierra
Leone, deprived me of three thousand dollars. Fana-Toro made
numerous assaults on his foes, all of which failed; and, to cap
the climax of my ills, on returning after a brief absence, I found
that a colonist, whom I had rescued from misery and employed
in my forge, had fled to the enemy, carrying with him a number
of my most useful servants.</p>

<p>It was about this time that circumstances obliged me to make
a rapid voyage to New York and back to Africa, where the blind
goddess had another surprise in store for me. During my absence,
our ancient king was compelled to make a treaty with his
rival, who, under the name of George Cain, dwelt formerly among
the American colonists and acquired our language. It was by
treachery alone that Fana-Toro had been dragooned into an
arrangement, by which my <i>quondam</i> blacksmith, who married a
sister of Cain, was elevated to the dignity of prince George&rsquo;s
<i>premier</i>!</p>

<p>Both these scamps, with a troop of their followers, planted
themselves on my premises near the beach, and immediately let
me understand that they were my sworn enemies. Cain could
not pardon the aid I gave to Fana-Toro in his earlier conflicts,
nor would the renegade colonist forsake his kinsman or the
African barbarism, into which he had relapsed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg&nbsp;445]</a></span>
By degrees, these varlets, whom I was unable, in my crippled
condition, to dislodge, obtained the ears of the British commanders,
and poured into them every falsehood that could kindle
their ire. The Spanish factory of Fana-Toro&rsquo;s agent was reported
to be <i>mine</i>. The shipment in the A&mdash;&mdash; and the adventure
of her boat, were said to be <i>mine</i>. Another suspected clipper
was declared to be <i>mine</i>. These, and a hundred lies of equal
baseness, were adroitly purveyed to the squadron by the outlaws,
and, in less than a month, my fame was as black as the skin of
my traducers. Still, even at this distant day, I may challenge
my worst enemy on the coast to prove that I participated, after
1839, in the purchase of a single slave for transportation beyond
the sea!</p>

<p>From the moment that the first dwelling was erected at New
Florence, I carefully enforced the most rigid decorum between
the sexes throughout my jurisdiction. It was the boast of our
friends at Cape Palmas and Monrovia, that my grounds were
free from the debauchery, which, elsewhere in Africa, was unhappily
too common. I have had the honor to entertain at my
table at Cape Mount, not only the ordinary traders of the coast,
but commodores of French squadrons, commanders of British
and American cruisers, governors of colonies, white and colored
missionaries, as well as innumerable merchants of the first respectability,
and I have yet to meet the first of them, in any part
of the world, who can redden my cheek with a blush.</p>

<p>But such was not the case at the Cape after Cain and Curtis
became the pets of the cruisers, and converted the beach into a
brothel.<a name="FNanchor_10_18" id="FNanchor_10_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_18" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg&nbsp;446]</a></span>
After a brief sojourn at my quarters to repair &ldquo;The Chancellor,&rdquo;
in which I had come with a cargo from the United
States, I hastened towards Gallinas to dispose of our merchandise.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg&nbsp;447]</a></span>
We had been already boarded by an American officer,
who reported us to his superior as a regular merchantman; yet,
such were the malicious representations on the beach against the
vessel and myself, that the Dolphin tarried a month at the anchorage
to watch our proceedings. When I went to the old mart
of Don Pedro, a cruiser dogged us; when I sailed to leeward
of Cape Palmas for oil and ivory, another took charge of our
movements,&mdash;anchoring where we anchored, getting under way
when we did, and following us into every nook and corner. At
Grand Buttoa, I took &ldquo;The Chancellor&rdquo; within a reef of rocks,
and here I was left to proceed as I pleased, while the British
cruiser returned to Cape Mount.</p>

<p>The fifteenth of March, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, is
scored in my calendar with black. It was on the morning of
that day that the commander who escorted me so warily as far
as Buttoa, landed a lieutenant and sailors at New Florence, and
unceremoniously proceeded to search my premises for slaves.
As none were found, the valiant captors seized a couple of handcuffs,
like those in use every where to secure refractory seamen,
and carried them on board to their commander. Next day, several
boats, with marines and sailors, led by a British captain
and lieutenant, landed about noon, and, without notice, provocation,
or even allowing my clerk to save his raiment, set fire to my
brigantine, store-houses, and dwelling.</p>

<p>As I was absent, I cannot vouch for every incident of this
transaction, but I have the utmost confidence in the circumstantial
narrative which my agent, Mr. Horace Smith, soon after
prepared under oath at Monrovia. The marines and Kroomen
were permitted to plunder at will. Cain and Curtis revelled
in the task of philanthropic destruction. While the sailors
burnt my houses, these miscreants and their adherents devoted
themselves to the ruin of my garden, fruit trees, plantations, and
waterworks. My cattle, even, were stolen, to be sold to the
squadron; and, ere night, New Florence was a smouldering heap!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg&nbsp;448]</a></span>
I would gladly have turned the last leaf of this book without
a murmur, had not this wanton outrage been perpetrated, not
only while I was abroad, but without a shadow of justice. To
this hour, I am ignorant of any lawful cause, or of any thing but
suspicion, that may be alleged in palliation of the high-handed
wrong. Not a line or word was left, whereby I could trace a
pretext for my ruin.</p>

<p>Three days after the catastrophe, my ancient ally of Toso
paid the debt of nature. In a month, his tribes awoke from
their stupor with one of those fiery spasms that are not uncommon
in Africa, and, missing their &ldquo;white man&rdquo; and his merchandise,
rose in a mass, and, without a word of warning, sacrificed
the twin varlets of the beach and restored their lawful
prince.</p>

a letter of introduction which I received by the hands of the Reverend
Mr. Williams, whilst I inhabited Cape Mount. Mr. Williams had been a former
governor of Liberia, and was deputed to Cape Mount by the Methodist
Episcopal Mission, in Liberia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir:</span><br /></p>

<p>&ldquo;This will be handed you by the Rev. A. D. Williams, a
minister of the M. E. Church, with whom you are so well acquainted that I
hardly need introduce him. It is a matter of regret that I am so situated
as to be unable to accompany Mr. Williams to Cape Mount. It would have
afforded me pleasure to visit your establishment, and it might have facilitated
our mission operations, could I have done so. Allow me, however to bespeak
for Mr. Williams your attention and patronage, both of which you
have, in conversation, so kindly promised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our object is to elevate the natives of Cape Mount; to establish a
school for children; to have divine service regularly performed on the Sabbath;
and thus to endeavor to introduce among the people a knowledge of
the only wise and true God and the blessings of Christianity. Such is the
immense influence you have over the Cape Mount people, in consequence
of your large territorial possessions, that a great deal of the success of our
efforts will depend on you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To your endeavors, then, for our prosperity, we look very anxiously.
In the course of a few months, should circumstances warrant the expense,
I intend to erect suitable buildings for divine service, and for the occupation
of the missionary and his family. In this case, we shall have to intrude
on your land for building room. I shall endeavor to visit Cape Mount as
soon as possible.</p>

<p class="sig1">&ldquo;I remain, my dear sir,</p>
<p class="sig2">&ldquo;Yours truly,</p>
<p class="sig3">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">John Seys</span>.</p>

<p class="receipt1">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">To Theodore Canot, Esq.</span>,</p>
<p class="receipt2">&ldquo;<i>Cape Mount</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would have afforded me sincere pleasure to gratify Messrs. Williams
and Seys but, unluckily, they had chosen the worst time imaginable for the
establishment of a mission and school. The country was ravaged by war,
and the towns were depopulated. The passions of the tribes were at their
height. Still, as I had promised my co-operation, I introduced the Rev.
Mr. Williams to the king, who courteously told the missionary all the dangers
and difficulties of his position, but promised, should the conflict speedily
end, to send him notice, when a &ldquo;book-man&rdquo; would be received with
pleasure.</p>

<p>To give my reverend friend a proof of the scarcity of people <i>in the towns</i>,
I sent messages to Toso, Fanama and Sugarei, for the inhabitants to assemble
at New Florence on the next Sunday, to hear &ldquo;God&rsquo;s palabra,&rdquo; (as they
call sacred instruction;) but when the Sabbath came, the Rev. Mr. Williams
held forth to my clerk, mechanics and servants, alone!</p>

<p>I reported the mortifying failure to the Rev. Mr. Seys, and Mr. W.
returned to Monrovia.</p>

<h3>FARMINGDALE,</h3>

<p class="center">A TALE</p>

<p class="center">BY CAROLINE THOMAS.</p>

<p class="center">Two volumes, 12mo., paper covers, 75 cents, or 2 volumes in 1, cloth, $1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a story of New England life, skilfully told, full of tender interest, healthy in its
sentiments and remarkably graphic in its sketches of character. &lsquo;Aunt Betsy&rsquo; is drawn
to the life.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Home Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Farmingdale is the best novel of the season.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Eve. Post.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will compare favorably with the &lsquo;Lamplighter,&rsquo; by Miss Cummings, and the
&lsquo;Wide, Wide World,&rsquo; by Miss Warner, and in interest it is quite equal to either.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Transcript.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Farmingdale,&rsquo; the work to which we allude, in every page and paragraph, is redolent
of its native sky. It is a tale of New England domestic life, in its incidents and manners
so true to nature and so free from exaggeration, and in its impulses and motives throughout
so throbbing with the real American heart, that we shall not be surprised to hear of as
many New England villages claiming to be the scene of its story, as were the cities of
Greece that claimed to be the birth place of Homer.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Courier.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The story abounds in scenes of absorbing interest. The narration is every where delightfully
clear and straightforward, flowing forth towards its conclusion, like a gentle and
limpid stream, between graceful hillsides and verdant meadows.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Home Journal.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a story of country life, written by a hand whose guiding power was a living
soul. The pictures of life are speaking and effective. The story is interestingly told and its
high moral aim well sustained.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Syracuse Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Farmingdale,&rsquo; while it has many points in common with some recent works of fiction,
is yet highly original. The author has had the boldness to attempt a novel, the main
interest of which does not hinge either upon love or matrimony, nor upon complicated and
entangled machinery, but upon a simple and apparently artless narrative of a friendless
girl.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Eve. Mail.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The author studiously avoids all forced and unnatural incidents, and the equally
fashionable affectation of extravagant language. Her style and diction are remarkable for
their purity and ease. In the conception and delineation of character she has shown herself
possessed of the true creative power.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Com. Adv.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A simple yet beautiful story, told in a simple and beautiful manner. The object is to
show the devoted affection of a sister to a young brother, and the sacrifices which she made
for him from childhood. There is touching simplicity in the character of this interesting
female that will please all readers, and benefit many of her sex.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The tale is prettily written, and breathes throughout an excellent moral tone.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston
Daily Journal.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have read this book; it is lively, spirited, and in some parts pathetic. Its sketches
of life seem to us at once graceful and vivid.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany Argus.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The book is well written, in a simple, unpretending style, and the dialogue is natural
and easy. It is destined to great popularity among all classes of readers. Parents who
object placing &lsquo;love tales&rsquo; in the hands of their children, may purchase this volume without
fear. The oldest and the youngest will become interested in its fascinating pages, and
close it with the impression that it is a good book, and deserving of the greatest popularity.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Worcester
Palladium.</i></p>

<h3>THE HEIR OF REDCLYFFE.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Tale.</span> 2 vols. 12mo. Paper, $1.00; cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A novel of really high merit. The characters are most skilfully drawn out in the
course of the story. The death of Guy is one of the most touching things we ever
read. * * * The work is one of absorbing interest, and what is still better, the moral
taught in its pages is eminently healthy and elevating. We commend the book most
cordially.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Com. Adv.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole tone and feeling of this book is good and true. The reader does not
require to be told that the author is religious; the right principles, the high sense of
duty and honor, softened by the influence of a reverent faith, can be explained on no
other hypothesis. It is eminently a book to send the reader away from the perusal better
and wiser for the lessons hidden under its deeply interesting narrative.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London
Guardian.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A well written, spirited and interesting work. It is full of character, sparkling
with conversation and picturesque with paintings of nature. The plot is well conceived
and handsomely wrought out. There is a freshness of feeling and tone of healthy
sentiment about such novels, that recommend them to public favor.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany Spectator.</i></p>

&ldquo;Eastbury,&rdquo; &amp;c. 12mo. Paper cover, 50 cents; cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a beautiful and ably written story.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Churchman.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The story is well written, and will be read with much pleasure as well as profit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lansingburgh

<p>&ldquo;A novel with a deep religious tone, bearing and aim&mdash;a most attractive style.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Springfield

<p>&ldquo;We recommend her books to the young, as among those from which they have
nothing to fear.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New Haven Courier.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A very well told tale, mingling the grave and gay, the tender and severe, in fair
proportions. It displays a genius and skill in the writer of no ordinary measure.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Trib.</i></p>

<h3>THE DEAN&rsquo;S DAUGHTER;</h3>

<p class="center">Or, THE DAYS WE LIVE IN.</p>

<p class="center">By Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gore</span>. 1 vol. 12mo. Paper, 50 cents; cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Dean&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo; will doubtless be one of the most successful books of the
season. It abounds in all those beauties which have hitherto distinguished Mrs. Gore&rsquo;s
novels. The management of the incidents of the story is as clever, the style is as brilliant,
the satire as keen, and the conversation as flowing, as in the best of her works.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily
News.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be read with pleasure by thousands.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Gore is perhaps the wittiest of modern novelists. Of all the ladies who in
later times have taken in hand the weapon of satire, her blade is certainly the most
trenchant. A vapid lord or a purse-proud citizen, a money-hunting woman of fashion
or a toad-eater, a <i>humbug</i> in short, male or female, and of whatsoever cast or quality he
may be, will find his pretensions well castigated in some one or other of her brilliant
pages; while scattered about in many places are passages and scenes of infinite tenderness
showing that our authoress is not insensible to the gentler qualities of our nature
and is mistress of pathos in no common degree.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>

<p class="center"><b>Opinions of the Press.</b></p>

<p>We know not where we will find purer morals, or more valuable &ldquo;life-philosophy,&rdquo;
than in the pages of Miss Sewell.&mdash;<i>Savannah Georgian.</i></p>

<p>The style and character of Miss Sewell&rsquo;s writings are too well-known to the reading
public to need commendation. The present volume will only add to her reputation as
an authoress.&mdash;<i>Albany Transcript.</i></p>

<p>This novel is admirably calculated to inculcate refined moral and religious sentiments.&mdash;<i>Boston
Herald.</i></p>

<p>The interest of the story is well sustained throughout, and it is altogether one of the
pleasantest books of the season.&mdash;<i>Syracuse Standard.</i></p>

<p>Those who have read the former works of this writer, will welcome the appearance
of this; it is equal to the best of her preceding novels.&mdash;<i>Savannah Republican.</i></p>

<p>Noble, beautiful, selfish, hard, and ugly characters appear in it, and each is so drawn
as to be felt and estimated as it deserves.&mdash;<i>Commonwealth.</i></p>

<p>A re-publication of a good English novel. It teaches self-control, charity, and a
true estimation of life, by the interesting history of a young girl.&mdash;<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>Katharine Ashton will enhance the reputation already attained, the story and the
moral being equally commendable.&mdash;<i>Buffalo Courier.</i></p>

<p>Like all its predecessors, Katharine Ashton bears the impress of genius, consecrated
to the noblest purposes, and should find a welcome in every family circle.&mdash;<i>Banner
of the Cross.</i></p>

<p>No one can be injured by books like this; a great many must be benefited. Few
authors have sent so many faultless writings to the press as she has done.&mdash;<i>Worcester
Palladium.</i></p>

<p>The <i>self-denial</i> of the Christian life, in its application to common scenes and circumstances,
is happily illustrated in the example of Katharine Ashton, in which there
is much to admire and imitate.&mdash;<i>Southern Churchman.</i></p>

<p>Her present work is an interesting tale of English country life, is written with her
usual ability, and is quite free from any offensive parade of her own theological tenets.&mdash;<i>Boston
Traveller.</i></p>

<p>The field in which Miss Sewell labors, seems to be exhaustless, and to yield always
a beautiful and a valuable harvest.&mdash;<i>Troy Daily Budget.</i></p>

<p class="center">MRS. COWDEN CLARKE&rsquo;S NEW ENGLISH NOVEL.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<h3>The Iron Cousin, or Mutual Influence.</h3>

<p class="center">BY MARY COWDEN CLARKE,</p>

<p class="center">Author of &ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Girlhood of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Heroines</span>;&rdquo; the &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Complete
Concordance To Shakespeare</span>,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p class="center">One handsomely printed volume, large 12mo. over 500 pages. Price $1.25&mdash;cloth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Clarke has given us one of the most delightful novels we have read for many
a day, and one which is destined, we doubt not, to be much longer lived than the majority
of the books of its class. Its chief beauties are a certain freshness in the style in which the incidents
are presented to us&mdash;a healthful tone pervading it&mdash;a completeness in most of the
characters&mdash;and a truthful power in the descriptions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Times.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have found the volume deeply interesting&mdash;its characters are well drawn, while
its tone and sentiments are well calculated to exert a purifying and ennobling influence
upon all who read it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Savannah Republican.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The scene of the book is village life amongst the upper class, with village episodes,
which seem to have been sketched from the life&mdash;there is a primitive simplicity and greatness
of heart about some of the characters which keep up the sympathy and interest to
the end.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Globe.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The reader cannot fail of being both charmed and instructed by the book, and of
hoping that a pen so able will not lie idle.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Pennsylvanian.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;We fearlessly recommend it as a work of more than ordinary merit.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Binghampton
Daily Republic.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The great moral lesson indicated by the title-page of this book runs, as a golden thread,
through every part of it, while the reader is constantly kept in contact with the workings
of an inventive and brilliant mind.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany Argus.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have read this fascinating story with a good deal of interest. Human nature is
well and faithfully portrayed, and we see the counterpart of our story in character and
disposition, in every village and district. The book cannot fail of popular reception.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany
and Rochester Courier.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A work of deep and powerful influence.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Herald.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cowden Clarke, with the delicacy and artistic taste of refine womanhood, has in
this work shown great versatility of talent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The story is too deeply interesting to allow the reader to lay it down till he has read
it to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The work is skilful in plan, graphic in style, diversified in incident and true to nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tale is charmingly imagined. The incidents never exceed probability but seem
perfectly natural. In the style there is much quaintness, in the sentiment much tenderness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a spirited, charming story, full of adventure, friendship and love, with characters
nicely drawn and carefully discriminated. The clear style and spirit with which the story
is presented and the characters developed, will attract a large constituency to the perusal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cowden Clarke&rsquo;s story has one of the highest qualities of fiction&mdash;it is no flickering
shadow, but seems of real growth. It is full of lively truth, and show nice perception of
the early elements of character with which we become acquainted in its wholeness, and in
the ripeness of years. The incident is well woven; the color is blood-warm; and there is
the presence of a sweet grace and gentle power.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center"><b>CRITICISMS OF THE PRESS.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a volume of eloquent and impressive essays on the domestic relations and the
religious duties of the household. Mr. Osgood writes on those interesting themes in the
most charming and animated style, winning the reader&rsquo;s judgment rather than coercing
it to the author&rsquo;s conclusions. The predominant sentiments in the book are purity, sincerity,
and love. A more delightful volume has rarely been published, and we trust it will
have a wide circulation, for its influence must be salutary upon both old and young.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Commercial
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Hearth-Stone&rsquo; is the symbol of all those delightful truths which Mr. Osgood
here connects with it. In a free and graceful style, varying form deep solemnity to the most
genial and lively tone, as befits his range of subjects, he gives attention to wise thoughts on
holy things, and homely truths. His volume will find many warm hearts to which it will
address itself.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Christian Examiner.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The author of his volume passes through a large circle of subjects, all of them connected
with domestic life as it exists in large towns. The ties of relationship&mdash;the female
character as developed in the true province and empire of woman, domestic life, the education
of children, and the training them to habits of reverence&mdash;the treatment of those
of our households whose lot in life is humbler than ours&mdash;the cultivation of a contented
mind&mdash;the habitual practice of devotion&mdash;these and various kindred topics furnish ample
matter for touching reflections and wholesome counsels. The spirit of the book is fervently
religious, and though no special pains are taken to avoid topics on which religious men
differ, it &lsquo;breathes a kindly spirit above the reach of sect or party.&rsquo; The author is now
numbered among the popular preachers of the metropolis, and those who have listened
to his spoken, will not be disappointed with his written, eloquence.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A household book, treating of the domestic relations, the deportment, affections, and
duties which belong to the well ordered Christian family. Manly advice and good sense
are exhibited in an earnest and affectionate tone, and not without tenderness and truthful
sentiment; while withal a Christian view is taken of the serious responsibility which attends
the performance of the duties of husband and wife, parent and child, sister and brother.
We are particularly pleased with the real practical wisdom, combined with the knowledge
of human nature, which renders this volume deserving of careful study by those who desire
to make their homes happy.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Churchman.</i></p>

<p class="center">I.</p>

<h3>DAISY BURNS.</h3>

<p class="center">12mo. Two parts. Paper Cover, 75 cents; or in 1 Vol. cloth, $1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The clear conception, the forcible delineation, the style, at once elegant and powerful,
of Miss Kavanagh&rsquo;s former works, are exhibited in this, as well as deep thought and
sound moral reflection. Every thing presented to the reader, whether thought or image,
is elaborated with the finish of a Flemish painting without its grossness; the persons
are nicely conceived and consistently sustained, and the principal narrative is relieved
by very truthful pictures of every day life and character.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>London Spectator.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A very delightful tale. * * * The charm of the story is in its naturalness. It
is perfectly quiet, domestic, and truthful. In the calm force and homely realities of its
scenes it reminds us of Miss Austen.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;All her books are written with talent and a woman&rsquo;s true feeling.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>U. S. Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is full of deep feeling, tenderness, pure feminine sentiment and moral truth.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany
Knickerbocker.</i></p>

<p class="center">II.</p>

<h3>NATHALIE.</h3>

<p class="center">Two Parts. 12mo. Paper Covers, 75 cents; cloth, $1.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A work of extraordinary merit, with a far deeper design than merely to arouse, it
attempts to solve some of the subtle problems of human nature. Some of the wisest
lessons in life are taught in the work, while the artistic skill with which the narrative
is managed imparts a vivid interest. The author might be, with a stronger infusion of
the poetic element, another Joanna Baillie; and no one will read the work without a
high estimate of her dramatic powers and her deep insight.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Evangelist.</i></p>

<p class="center">III.</p>

<h3>MADELEINE.</h3>

<p class="center">One Volume. 12mo. Paper Covers, 50 cents; cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A charming story, gracefully told. Its intrinsic interest as a narrative, and the
tenderness of its pathos will win for it many readers.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Traveller.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The character of Madeleine, the heroine, is beautifully drawn and powerfully portrayed.
Miss Kavanagh is most known by her excellent novel of &lsquo;Nathalie.&rsquo; This book
possesses no less interest, though of a very different kind.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Courier and Enq.</i></p>

<p class="center">IV.</p>

<h3>WOMEN OF CHRISTIANITY.</h3>

<p class="center">One Volume. 12mo. Cloth, 75 cents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The design and spirit of this volume are alike admirable. Miss Kavanagh divides
her work into four periods; the first relates the deeds of holy women under the Roman
empire; the second tells us of the fruits of faith in the middle ages; the third is devoted
to the women of the seventeenth century; and the fourth to those of the eighteenth and
present centuries. We have read many of these records of other days, as told by Miss
Kavanagh, and we are sure that the influence upon every Christian-minded person
cannot but be for good, if he will meditate upon what our holy religion is every day doing.
The volume is well worthy a place in every Christian family.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Ban. of the Cross.</i></p>

<h3>Tempest and Sunshine; or, Life in Kentucky.</h3>

<p class="center">BY MRS. MARY J. HOLMES.</p>

<p class="center">One Volume, 12mo. Paper covers, 75 cents; cloth, $1.</p>

<p>These are the most striking and original sketches of American
character in the South-western States which have ever been published.
The character of Tempest is drawn with all that spirit and
energy which characterize the high toned female spirit of the
South, while Sunshine possesses the loveliness and gentleness of
the sweetest of her sex. The Planter is sketched to the life, and
in his strongly marked, passionate, and generous nature, the reader
will recognize one of the truest sons of the south-west.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p class="center"><b>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;The book is well written, and its fame will be more than ephemeral.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Buffalo
Express.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The story is interesting and finely developed.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Daily Times.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A lively romance of western life&mdash;the style of the writer is smart, intelligent, and
winning, and her story is told with spirit and skill.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>U. S. Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent work, and its sale must be extensive.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Stamford Advocate.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole is relieved by a generous introduction of incident as well as by an amplitude
of love and mystery.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Express.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A delightful, well written book, portraying western life to the letter. The book
abounds in an easy humor, with touching sentences of tenderness and pathos scattered
through it, and from first to last keeps up a humane interest that very many authors
strive in vain to achieve. &lsquo;Tempest&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sunshine,&rsquo; two sisters, are an exemplification
of the good that to some comes by nature, and to others is found only through
trials, temptation, and tribulation. Mr. Middleton, the father of &lsquo;Tempest&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sunshine&rsquo;
is the very soul and spirit of &lsquo;Old Kaintuck,&rsquo; abridged into one man. The book
is worth reading. There is a healthy tone of morality pervading it that will make it a
suitable work to be placed in the hands of our daughters and sisters.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New York Day
Book.</i></p>

<p class="center">Fifth Edition now ready.</p>

<h3>RUSSIA AS IT IS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By Count A. de Gurowski.</span></p>

<p class="center">One neat volume 12mo., pp. 328, well printed. Price $1, cloth.</p>

from an Old Chronicle.</p>

<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p class="center"><b>Notices of the Press.</b></p>

<p>&ldquo;The author takes no superficial, empirical view of his subject, but collecting a rich
variety of facts, brings the lights of a profound philosophy to their explanation. His work,
indeed, neglects no essential detail&mdash;it is minute and accurate in its statistics&mdash;it abounds
in lively pictures of society, manners and character. * * * Whoever wishes to obtain an
accurate notion of the internal condition of Russia, the nature and extent of her resources,
and the practical influence of her institutions, will here find better materials for his purpose
than in any single volume now extant.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a powerfully-written book, and will prove of vast service to every one who
desires to comprehend the real nature and bearings of the great contest in which Russia is
now engaged.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Courier.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is original in its conclusions; it is striking in its revelations. Numerous as are the
volumes that have been written about Russia, we really hitherto have known little of that
immense territory&mdash;of that numerous people. Count Gurowski&rsquo;s work sheds a light which
at this time is most welcome and satisfactory.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Times.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The book is well written, and as might be expected in a work by a writer so unusually
conversant with all sides of Russian affairs, it contains so much important information
respecting the Russian people, their government and religion.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Com. Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a valuable work, explaining in a very satisfactory manner the internal conditions
of the Russian people, and the construction of their political society. The institutions of
Russia are presented as they exist in reality, and as they are determined by existing and
obligatory laws.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Herald.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A hasty glance over this handsome volume has satisfied us that it is one worthy of
general perusal. * * * It is full of valuable historical information, with very interesting
accounts of the various classes among the Russian people, their condition and
aspirations.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>N. Y. Sun.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a volume that can hardly fail to attract very general attention, and command a
wide sale in view of the present juncture of European affairs, and the prominent part
therein which Russia is to play.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Utica Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A timely book. It will be found all that it professes to be, though some may be startled
at some of its conclusions.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Boston Atlas.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;This is one of the best of all the books caused by the present excitement in relation to
Russia. It is a very able publication&mdash;one that will do much to destroy the general belief
in the infallibility of Russia. The writer shows himself master of his subject, and treats of
the internal condition of Russia, her institutions and customs, society, laws, &amp;c., in an
enlightened and scholarly manner.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>City Item.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Life, in its varied relations at the North and the South, is the theme of this
work. In its graphic delineations of character, truthfulness of representation, and stirring
realities of life, it will hardly give place to &lsquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin.&rsquo; The authoress
is well-known to the public by her many charming works of fiction, and her life has
been passed at the North of South. The nobleness of her sentiments, her elevated and

<p>&ldquo;We like this work exceedingly, and our fair country women will admire it still more

a clear insight into the evils surrounding and pressing down her sex, and a glorious determination
to expose and remove them. Read her work. She will win a willing way

pure sentiment with high principle, and noble views of life and its duties, ought to win
for them a hearing at every fireside in our land. We have rarely perused a tale more
